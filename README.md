## üéØ Vision
ai agents are clearly the future and the entire workforce will be replaced or atleast using ai agents. while i am a quant and building agents for algo trading i will be contributing to all different types of ai agent flows and placing all of the agents here for free, 100% open sourced because i beleive code is the great equalizer and we have never seen a regime shift like this so i need to get this code to the people

feel free to join our discord if you beleive ai agents will be integrated into the workforce

3. üíª **Open in Your IDE**
   - Clone to your local machine
   - Recommended: Use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Windsurfer](https://codeium.com/) for AI-enabled coding

4. üîë **Set Environment Variables**
   - Check `.env.example` for required variables
   - Create a copy of above and name it `.env` file with your keys:

## ROADMAP

[] hyperliquid perps integration
   - build a nice funcs router to be able to pass in solana, hyperliquid, extended and then it points to the right nice_funcs -- then we simply change out the imports.
[] polymarket integration
[] extended integration
   - same thing as above
[] hyperliquid spot
[] trending agent - spots the leaders on hl and trades those w/ data and some llm bias
[] update the rbi agent. my fav so keep pushing

Other ideas

[] lighter integration
[] pacifica integration
[] hibachi integration
[] aster integration
[] hyperevm stuff
