I haven't started building this agent yet. But the idea 
behind this agent is to look at sentiment from using a 
Python library called TWI PY and using that to monitor our 
token list symbols and getting the, the, the sentiment based 
off of those. We can use a hugging face model to judge the 
sentiment if we get enough data. And then we can also look 
at other tokens that were mentioned in those tweets that 
are on our monitor token suites because there might be 
alpha within those as well. So that's the idea here. 
It's not built yet, but it is on my build list.
