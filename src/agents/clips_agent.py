this ai agent will be able to take long videos and make short videos

enabling this ai agent to help you earn money while you learn to code

you get paid by most streamers to make clips of their streams

i have so much gold in my videos and things that can truly help people

if you want to learn how to code and get paid while you do it

you should just watch my videos and when you see something that you think is gold, you can make a clip out of it

and you can get paid by me for that

check out the #clips channel in discord for more info: https://discord.gg/XAw8US9aHT

examples of people crushing it with my videos:

https://www.youtube.com/@Algonomicstrades
https://www.youtube.com/@moondevonytsnips

they essentially get paid to watch my coding videos and make clips of the good parts

because i dont have time to make clips i can only stream as im building my algos

steps to your success as a moon dev clipper:
1. find good long videos on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/@moondevonyt/videos 
2. watch the video and find the parts that are good
3. make a clip out of it (5 mins-2hours in length)
4. upload the clip to your youtube channel (youtube only, no youtube shorts)
5. when you hit 10,000 views, get paid $69

Standard payout is $69 per 10,000 views but it increases based on your views per month..

10,000 views per month = $69 per 10,000 views
30,000 views per month = $89 per 10,000 views 
50,000 views per month = $100 per 10,000 views
100,000 views per month = $149 per 10,000 views

BONUS GROUP: once you hit 10,000 views per month, you get access to a private channel in discord with training on how to get more views

payments are via crypto on the 1st and 15th of every month, when you hit 10,000 views per month + just email the link, and your tracking of the views to moondevonyt@gmail.com

* if in the USA, you can only earn up to $500 per year but in the rest of the world, you can earn unlimited.

Where do you get the videos from?
1. this dropbox has a bunch of my videos that i will upload to daily: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/d0rjdyus9q3pok5nbmo7b/AM9LOmUDv8KIjmH6ypTALx0?rlkey=klg4tinvneqyui46r6851liwa&st=0zxfym3w&dl=0
2. you have permission to download any of my youtube videos: https://www.youtube.com/@moondevonyt/videos

how do i clip the videos manually?
1. download capcut: https://www.capcut.com/
2. find the interesting parts of the video and make a 5 min - 2 hour clip of it
3. make an interesting thumbnail & title for the clip (you can use my thumbnails if needed, just google how to download)
4. post on youtube
5. when you hit 10,000 views email your link and stats to moondevonyt@gmail.com to get paid

how do i clip videos with this agent?
1. put in my long videos into this folder path src/data/videos/raw_clips
2. make sure to have this folder too src/data/videos/finished_vids this is the output folder
3. run the code and wait for them to output to the above folder
4. make a good thumbnail and title then upload to youtube
5. wait for 10,000 views and email the link and stats to moondevonyt@gmail.com to get paid

here is another training video, the only difference is that we only accept long youtube videos now. the below training is helpful though.

training video to learn how to clip videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqWax0EPkcs

all of my videos you can use: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/d0rjdyus9q3pok5nbmo7b/AM9LOmUDv8KIjmH6ypTALx0?rlkey=klg4tinvneqyui46r6851liwa&st=0zxfym3w&dl=0
- you can also download the videos from my channel: https://www.youtube.com/@moondevonyt/videos
