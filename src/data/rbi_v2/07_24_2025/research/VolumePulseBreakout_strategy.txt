STRATEGY_NAME: VolumePulse Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume analysis with oversold oscillator conditions to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components are:

1. INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- 20-period Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
- 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Volume bars (standard or better volume profile)

2. ENTRY CONDITIONS (ALL must be met):
- Price must be in the lower Bollinger Band (below 20-period SMA)
- RSI below 30 (oversold condition)
- Current candle's volume exceeds VWMA by 150%
- Price closes above the lower Bollinger Band
- Confirmation: Next candle opens higher than previous close

3. EXIT RULES:
- Take Profit 1: 1.5x ATR (14) from entry (partial exit)
- Take Profit 2: Upper Bollinger Band (full exit)
- Stop Loss: Lower low of entry candle or 2% below entry (whichever is closer)

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size limited to 2% of capital per trade
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
- Trade only during high volume hours (first 2 hours of session)
- Maximum 5 open positions at any time

5. FILTERS:
- Only applies to assets with average daily volume > 1M shares
- Avoid earnings announcement periods
- Preferred timeframes: 15min - 4hr charts

6. SPECIAL NOTES:
- Works best in ranging markets with clear support/resistance
- Avoid using during strong trending markets
- Volume spike must be significant (minimum 150% of VWMA)
- Combine with sector/industry strength for better results

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive moves that often follow oversold conditions when accompanied by unusually high volume, suggesting institutional accumulation before a breakout. The volume confirmation helps filter out false oversold signals.
