STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (BB):** Used to measure volatility and identify potential breakout points. The strategy focuses on periods where volatility is below its average (narrowing bands).  
2. **Volatility Threshold:** A predefined condition where the width of the Bollinger Bands (Upper Band - Lower Band) is below its historical average, indicating low volatility.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** A breakout is confirmed when the price closes below the lower Bollinger Band, signaling a potential short opportunity.  
4. **Exit Condition:** The trade is exited when the price touches or crosses the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential reversal or volatility expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Volatility Check:** Ensure the Bollinger Bands' width (Upper Band - Lower Band) is below its 20-period moving average (or another chosen lookback period).  
2. **Breakout Signal:** Enter a short position when the price closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  
3. **Confirmation (Optional):** Add a filter like a bearish candlestick pattern or RSI below 50 to avoid false breakouts.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Exit the short position when the price touches or crosses the upper Bollinger Band.  
2. **Stop-Loss (Optional):** Place a stop-loss above the recent swing high or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) to limit losses if the breakout fails.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk only 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Use a trailing stop or fixed stop-loss to protect against adverse moves.  
3. **Avoid Overcrowded Trades:** Do not enter if multiple conflicting signals (e.g., RSI oversold) are present.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – Primary volatility and breakout tool.  
2. **Moving Average of Bollinger Band Width (optional)** – To confirm low volatility conditions.  
3. **RSI (14-period, optional)** – For additional confirmation of momentum.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or consolidating markets.  
- Avoid during high-volatility news events or trending markets where false breakouts are common.  
- Backtest to optimize parameters (e.g., Bollinger Band period, standard deviation multiplier).  

This strategy capitalizes on mean-reversion tendencies after low-volatility periods, with clear rules for entry and exit.
