STRATEGY_NAME: BandedReversion  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Mean-Reversion Focus**: The strategy capitalizes on price retracements toward the mean when oversold conditions are detected.  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)**: Used to identify oversold conditions when the lower band is above the 20-period moving average (MA).  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14)**: Sets dynamic stop-loss levels at 2x ATR to manage risk while allowing for potential re-tests.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when the price touches or crosses below the lower Bollinger Band **AND** the lower band is above the 20-period MA.  
- **Confirmation**: Optional: Wait for a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., hammer, engulfing) or RSI(14) > 30 to avoid false signals.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop-Loss**: Placed at **2x ATR (14)** below the entry price to account for volatility.  
- **Take-Profit**: No fixed target; the trade is held until either:  
  - The price retests the 20-period MA (partial exit).  
  - The stop-loss is hit.  
  - A bearish reversal pattern forms near the MA (full exit).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on a fixed % of capital (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events to reduce volatility risk.  
- Filter out downtrends using a higher timeframe (e.g., only trade if 50 MA is flat or rising on the 4H chart).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20, 2)  
2. 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)  
3. ATR (14)  
4. Optional: RSI (14) or higher timeframe MA for trend confirmation.  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines Bollinger Band oversold signals with a volatility-adjusted stop (ATR) to avoid premature exits during retracements.  
- The 20 MA acts as a "mean" reference, while the lower band's position above it filters stronger reversions.  

**Backtest Considerations:**  
- Test on assets with mean-reverting tendencies (e.g., indices, ETFs).  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5x-3x) based on asset volatility.  
- Optimize confirmation filters (e.g., RSI thresholds) to reduce whipsaws.
