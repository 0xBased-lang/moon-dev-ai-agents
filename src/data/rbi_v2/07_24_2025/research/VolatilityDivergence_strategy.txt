STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Identification:** The strategy focuses on identifying bullish trends by combining RSI divergence with increasing VIX (volatility index).  
2. **Divergence Detection:** Looks for bullish RSI divergence (price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows) to signal potential trend reversals or continuations.  
3. **Volatility Confirmation:** Uses rising VIX as a confirmation of increasing market uncertainty, which often precedes strong trend moves.  
4. **Exit Mechanism:** Exits trades based on multiples of the Average True Range (ATR) to dynamically adjust for market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Price forms a lower low, but RSI forms a higher low (bullish divergence).  
  2. VIX is increasing over the last 3-5 periods (confirms rising volatility).  
  3. Entry occurs on the next candle after divergence is confirmed.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** 2x ATR (from entry point) for partial exit, 3x ATR for full exit.  
- **Stop Loss:** 1x ATR below the entry candle's low (trailing stop can be applied).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on ATR to ensure consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low VIX periods (below a defined threshold) to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **RSI (14-period):** For divergence detection.  
2. **VIX (or equivalent volatility index):** To confirm rising volatility.  
3. **ATR (14-period):** For dynamic stop-loss and profit targets.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid sideways conditions.  
- Combine with volume analysis for higher conviction.  
- Backtest optimal ATR multiples for different asset classes.  

This strategy leverages volatility expansion and momentum shifts for high-probability trend entries while using ATR for adaptive risk management.
