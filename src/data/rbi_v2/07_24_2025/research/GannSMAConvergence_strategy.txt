STRATEGY_NAME: GannSMAConvergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Gann angle analysis with a 5-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) to identify high-probability intraday trading opportunities. The unique aspect lies in using the intersection points between these two technical tools as profit targets.

Key Components:
1. Gann Angles: Primary trend identification tool drawn from significant price pivots
2. 5-period SMA: Secondary confirmation filter for trend direction
3. Price-SMA relationship: Determines trade bias (long/short)
4. Gann-SMA intersections: Used as profit targets

Entry Rules:
LONG:
- Price must be above the 5-period SMA (uptrend confirmation)
- Price must be interacting with an upward Gann angle (1x1 or 2x1 preferred)
- Entry when price bounces off the Gann angle with SMA confirmation

SHORT:
- Price must be below the 5-period SMA (downtrend confirmation)
- Price must be interacting with a downward Gann angle (1x1 or 2x1 preferred)
- Entry when price rejects from the Gann angle with SMA confirmation

Exit Rules:
Profit Targets:
- Primary target at next Gann angle/SMA intersection point
- Secondary target at next significant Gann angle level
- Trail stop using the 5-period SMA once price reaches first target

Stop Loss:
- Below the most recent swing low (for longs) or above swing high (for shorts)
- Alternative: 1.5x ATR (14) from entry point

Required Indicators:
1. Gann Angles (1x1, 2x1, 1x2)
2. 5-period Simple Moving Average (Close)
3. Optional: 14-period ATR for volatility-based stops

Timeframe:
Optimized for 15-minute to 1-hour charts in liquid markets

Risk Management:
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
- No trades during first/last 30 minutes of session (avoid opening gaps/closing volatility)
- Trade only when Gann angle and SMA show clear convergence

Unique Features:
- Uses Gann angles as dynamic support/resistance rather than static levels
- SMA acts as both trend filter and trailing stop mechanism
- Profit targets based on mathematical convergence of two different technical approaches
- Particularly effective in trending markets with clear angular structure
