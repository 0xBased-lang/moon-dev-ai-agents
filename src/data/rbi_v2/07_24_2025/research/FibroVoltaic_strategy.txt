STRATEGY_NAME: FibroVoltaic  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
The FibroVoltaic strategy combines Fibonacci retracement levels with contracting Average True Range (ATR) bands to identify high-probability entries during uptrends with declining volatility, exiting on volatility expansion.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Trend Identification:**  
   - Use a 50-period EMA to confirm uptrend (price > EMA)  
   - Require higher highs/higher lows structure  

2. **Fibonacci Framework:**  
   - Draw retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) from recent swing low to high  
   - Focus on the 50-61.8% "golden zone" for entries  

3. **Volatility Contraction:**  
   - 14-period ATR must be below its 20-period SMA  
   - Price must be compressing within narrowing ATR bands  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Price must pull back to 50-61.8% Fib level  
2. ATR(14) must be below its 20-period SMA (contracting volatility)  
3. Enter long when:  
   - Price touches Fib level + shows bullish reversal candle  
   - Stop placed below recent swing low  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Taking:**  
   - First target at 161.8% Fib extension  
   - Trail stop using 3x ATR  

2. **Stop Out:**  
   - Close if price breaks below entry swing low  
   - Emergency exit if ATR expands >20% from entry level  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade  
- Minimum 1:3 risk-reward ratio required  
- No trades during major economic events  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Fibonacci retracement tool  
2. 14-period ATR with 20-period SMA overlay  
3. 50-period EMA for trend filter  
4. Volume confirmation (optional but recommended)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines mean-reversion (Fib levels) with volatility contraction signals  
- Exploits the transition between low-volatility accumulation and high-volatility expansion phases  
- Particularly effective in ranging markets within broader uptrends  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different ATR periods (10-20) based on asset volatility  
- Adjust Fib zone focus (e.g., 38.2-50% for stronger trends)  
- Combine with RSI(14) >40 for additional confirmation
