STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityCorridorPutter

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility correlation analysis with precise expiration timing for put option selling. The approach focuses on capitalizing on mean-reverting volatility patterns while using price action triggers for execution.

Key Components:
1. VIX-S&P Correlation Band: Monitor the 20-day rolling correlation between VIX and SPX, only trading when within ±5% of zero correlation
2. Expiration Timing: Execute only on option expiration days (typically Fridays)
3. Price Action Triggers: Use daily high/low patterns for precise entry/exit

Entry Rules:
1. Correlation Check: Confirm VIX-SPX correlation is between -0.05 and +0.05 (5% band)
2. Timing: Wait until expiration day (Friday)
3. Price Trigger: Enter short put position when price breaks above prior day's high
4. Strike Selection: Sell ATM or slightly OTM puts (5-10% below current price)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Close position if price reaches next day's low (calculated from prior day's range)
2. Time Exit: Automatically exit at market close on expiration day if not stopped out
3. Emergency Exit: Close position if VIX-SPX correlation breaks beyond ±10% band

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Limit to 5% of portfolio per trade
2. Maximum Allocation: No more than 20% of portfolio in active put positions
3. Volatility Filter: Skip trades if VIX > 30 (high volatility regime)
4. Correlation Monitoring: Daily check of VIX-SPX relationship

Required Indicators:
1. VIX Index
2. S&P 500 Index (SPX)
3. 20-day rolling correlation between VIX and SPX
4. Daily price high/low data
5. Option chain data (for strike selection)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different correlation bands (3-7% range)
- Experiment with various strike selection methods (fixed % vs. delta-based)
- Consider adding volume confirmation for entry triggers
- Backtest different holding periods (same-day vs. multi-day)

This strategy is designed for traders with access to real-time volatility data and option chains, offering a systematic approach to premium collection during low-correlation volatility regimes.
