STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicVWAPTrend  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **ADX (Average Directional Index)** – Used to measure the strength of a trend. A reading above 25 typically indicates a strong trend.  
2. **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)** – Acts as a dynamic support/resistance level. Price above VWAP suggests bullish bias, while price below suggests bearish bias.  
3. **Trend Confirmation** – The strategy requires both ADX strength and price alignment relative to VWAP for high-probability entries.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - ADX > 25 (strong trend)  
  - Price is above VWAP (bullish alignment)  
  - Enter on a pullback to VWAP (if price retests VWAP as support) or on a breakout above recent highs.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - ADX > 25 (strong trend)  
  - Price is below VWAP (bearish alignment)  
  - Enter on a retest of VWAP as resistance or on a breakdown below recent lows.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Trailing stop based on VWAP (exit long when price closes below VWAP, exit short when price closes above VWAP).  
  - Alternatively, use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - For longs: Place below the recent swing low or below VWAP (whichever is tighter).  
  - For shorts: Place above the recent swing high or above VWAP (whichever is tighter).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading if ADX is below 20 (weak/no trend).  
- Adjust position sizing based on volatility (e.g., wider stops require smaller positions).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ADX (14-period default)** – To confirm trend strength.  
2. **VWAP (daily reset)** – To identify dynamic support/resistance.  

This strategy works best in trending markets and avoids choppy conditions by relying on ADX filtering. The combination of VWAP alignment and trend strength provides high-confidence setups.
