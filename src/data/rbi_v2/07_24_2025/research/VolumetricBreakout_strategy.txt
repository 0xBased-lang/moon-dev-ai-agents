STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume Analysis**: The strategy relies heavily on trading volume to confirm breakout validity.  
2. **Price Breakout**: Identifies key support/resistance levels where price breaks out with significant volume.  
3. **Confirmation Indicators**: Uses moving averages (MA) and relative strength index (RSI) to filter false breakouts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Volume Spike**: Look for a sudden spike in trading volume (at least 1.5x the 20-day average volume).  
2. **Price Breakout**: Price must close above a resistance level (for long) or below support (for short).  
3. **RSI Confirmation**: RSI should not be in overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) territory to avoid reversals.  
4. **MA Alignment**: Price should be above the 50-day MA (for long) or below it (for short).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target**: Set a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio (e.g., if stop loss is 2%, take profit at 4%).  
2. **Trailing Stop**: Use a trailing stop of 1.5x the average true range (ATR) to lock in profits.  
3. **Volume Decline**: Exit if volume drops below the 20-day average, signaling weakening momentum.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop Loss**: Place stop loss just below the breakout level (for long) or above it (for short).  
2. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
3. **Avoid Choppy Markets**: Only trade when volatility (measured by ATR) is above its 14-day average.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Volume (20-day average & spike detection)**  
2. **50-day Moving Average (MA)**  
3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period)**  
4. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-period for trailing stop)**  

This strategy capitalizes on high-volume breakouts while filtering noise with trend and momentum confirmations.
