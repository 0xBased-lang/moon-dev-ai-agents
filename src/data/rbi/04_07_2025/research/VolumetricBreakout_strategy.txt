STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Breakout:** The strategy capitalizes on strong upward price movements by entering when price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential continuation of momentum.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires increasing volume to validate the breakout, ensuring participation and reducing false signals.  
3. **RSI Exit:** Uses RSI as an overbought indicator to exit trades when momentum starts fading.  
4. **ATR-Based Target:** Sets a profit target at 1.5x the Average True Range (ATR) to dynamically adjust for market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Price closes or moves above the upper Bollinger Band (typically set to 2 standard deviations).  
  - Volume is higher than the previous period, confirming strong buying interest.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit the trade when price reaches 1.5x the current ATR value from the entry price.  
- **RSI Exit:** Exit if the RSI (typically 14-period) crosses below 70, indicating weakening momentum.  
- **Stop Loss:** Optional but recommended—set at 1x ATR below the entry price to manage risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Adjust trade size based on ATR to ensure consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1% risk per trade).  
- **Stop Loss:** Use a trailing stop or fixed stop at 1x ATR to protect against reversals.  
- **Avoid Low-Volume Breakouts:** Filter out trades where volume does not confirm the breakout to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – Identifies volatility and potential breakout levels.  
2. **Volume Indicator** – Confirms breakout strength.  
3. **RSI (14-period)** – Monitors overbought conditions for exits.  
4. **ATR (14-period)** – Sets dynamic profit targets and stop-loss levels.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different Bollinger Band settings (e.g., 1.5 or 2.5 std dev) to adjust sensitivity.  
- Experiment with RSI thresholds (e.g., 65 or 75) to fine-tune exits.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (e.g., 1.2x or 2x) based on asset volatility.  

This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform in choppy or range-bound conditions. Always backtest before live implementation.
