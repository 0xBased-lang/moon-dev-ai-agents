STRATEGY_NAME: FlowVolatility Squeeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines exchange netflow analysis with Bollinger Band volatility measurements to identify high-probability shorting opportunities during periods of extreme market stress and capital outflow.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (2 standard deviation threshold)
2. Exchange Netflow (spike detection)
3. Volatility contraction signal (1 standard deviation)
4. Netflow reversal confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Bollinger Band width exceeds 2 standard deviations
2. Confirmation: Simultaneous spike in exchange netflow (outflow)
3. Execution: Enter short position when both conditions align

Exit Rules:
1. Volatility Exit: Bollinger Band width contracts below 1 standard deviation
2. Flow Exit: Exchange netflow shows reversal (inflow) pattern
3. Conservative Exit: Close position when either condition triggers
4. Aggressive Exit: Wait for both conditions (recommended for higher timeframe trades)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop-loss: 1.5x the Bollinger Band width at entry
3. Time-based exit: Close position if no exit triggers within 72 hours
4. Volatility filter: Only trade when average true range > 2% of price

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
2. Exchange Netflow metric (custom or platform-specific)
3. Standard Deviation calculation (for width measurement)
4. Optional: ATR (14-period) for volatility filter

Special Considerations:
- Works best on 4h or daily timeframes
- Most effective on high-cap altcoins with liquid markets
- Requires reliable exchange flow data source
- Backtest recommended for specific asset volatility profiles

The "FlowVolatility Squeeze" strategy capitalizes on the combination of technical volatility extremes and fundamental capital movement, creating a high-probability mean-reversion setup during market stress periods.
