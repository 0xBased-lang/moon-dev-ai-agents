STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on volatility contraction followed by expansion, using Bollinger Band width and volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout trades.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Measures the difference between upper and lower Bollinger Bands (typically 20-period, 2 Std Dev). A contraction below its 10-day low signals reduced volatility and potential impending breakout.  
2. **Volume Spike:** Breakouts require confirmation via volume exceeding the 20-day average, ensuring participation.  
3. **ATR-Based Risk/Reward:** Uses 3x the 14-period Average True Range (ATR) for both trailing stop-loss and profit target, adapting to market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger: Bollinger Band width (Upper Band - Lower Band) reaches a 10-day low.  
- Confirmation: Volume exceeds 20-day average volume.  
- Entry: Buy/sell on breakout of the prior candleâ€™s high/low (for long/short).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** 3x ATR from entry price.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Trailing stop set at 3x ATR below/above the highest/lowest close since entry (for long/short).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on stop distance (e.g., risking 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev) + width calculation.  
2. 20-day average volume.  
3. 14-period ATR for stop/target.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression (Bandwidth) with volume-fueled breakouts, filtered by ATR for dynamic risk/reward. Avoids choppy markets via volume confirmation.
