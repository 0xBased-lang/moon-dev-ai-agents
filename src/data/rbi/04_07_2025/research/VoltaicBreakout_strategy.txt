STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction:** Uses Bollinger Bandwidth percentile (<20) to identify periods of low volatility, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Volume Surge:** Requires trading volume to exceed the 50-day average, confirming strong participation in the breakout.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** Enters trades only when price breaks the 3-day high (for long) or low (for short) to ensure momentum.  
4. **Dynamic Stop-Loss:** Utilizes pivot points (e.g., daily or weekly) to set adaptive stop levels based on recent price structure.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth percentile < 20 (low volatility).  
  - Volume exceeds 50-day average.  
  - Price breaks above the 3-day high.  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth percentile < 20.  
  - Volume exceeds 50-day average.  
  - Price breaks below the 3-day low.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take-Profit:** Use a trailing stop or predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Placed below the nearest pivot support (long) or above pivot resistance (short). Adjust dynamically as new pivots form.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on stop distance (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  
- Filter trades with higher timeframe alignment (e.g., only trade breakouts in the direction of the weekly trend).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 StdDev) + Bandwidth Percentile.  
2. 50-day moving average of volume.  
3. Pivot Point Calculator (daily/weekly).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression, volume confirmation, and dynamic stops to capture high-probability breakouts while minimizing false signals.
