STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by explosive breakouts, combining Bollinger Band contraction with ATR-based confirmation and dynamic exit management.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement:
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2) to identify contraction periods
   - 20-day ATR as volatility threshold (default 1.5x multiplier)
   
2. Breakout Confirmation:
   - Price must close above upper Bollinger Band
   - Bollinger Band width must be below ATR threshold
   - Breakout candle must show above-average volume (optional filter)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger:
   - When Bollinger Band width (upper-lower) < (ATR20 * 1.5)
   - AND price closes above upper Bollinger Band
   - Enter long at next open

Exit Rules:
1. Dynamic Trailing Stop:
   - Initial stop: 50% of breakout candle's range below entry
   - Trail stop upward at 25% of subsequent candles' ranges
   - Never moves stop downward

2. Alternative Exit:
   - Close position if price crosses below middle Bollinger Band
   - OR after 10 bars without new high (time-based exit)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Stop distance determines position size

2. Volatility Filter:
   - Only trade when ATR > 0.5% of instrument price
   - Avoid extremely low liquidity conditions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. ATR (20)
3. Volume (optional confirmation)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.3-2.0) based on instrument volatility
- Test different trailing stop percentages (20-50%)
- Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., >30) for stronger momentum confirmation

This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation periods, with the VoltaicSqueeze name reflecting its explosive energy release from compressed volatility conditions.
