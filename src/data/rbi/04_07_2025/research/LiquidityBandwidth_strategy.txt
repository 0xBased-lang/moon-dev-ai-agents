STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidity analysis with volatility contraction to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. Here are the key components:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Liquidity Clusters: Identify price levels with significant orderbook activity (high volume nodes)
- Bollinger Band Width: Measures volatility contraction (narrowing bands indicate potential breakout)
- Orderbook Imbalance: Detects when buy/sell pressure becomes one-sided
- VWAP Confirmation: Ensures price is breaking out with institutional participation
- Volume Surge: Validates breakout with increased trading activity

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract to lowest 20% of recent range
- Identify liquidity cluster zones (price areas with highest volume concentration)
- Confirm orderbook imbalance (minimum 2:1 ratio favoring breakout direction)
- Price must break above/below cluster with volume > 150% of 20-period average
- Breakout must occur above recent VWAP (for long) or below (for short)

3. EXIT RULES:
- Initial target: 1.5x average true range from entry point
- Secondary target: Next significant liquidity cluster level
- Stop loss: Other side of the liquidity cluster or 0.75x ATR, whichever is closer

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Never risk more than 1% of capital per trade
- Position size based on distance to stop loss
- Reduce size during high volatility periods (when BB width > 50th percentile)
- Avoid trading during major news events

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for width measurement
- Volume Profile - to identify liquidity clusters
- Orderbook Depth - to measure imbalance
- VWAP (20 period)
- Volume (with 20-period average)
- Average True Range (14 period)

6. SPECIAL NOTES:
- Best timeframes: 15min to 4hr charts
- Most effective in trending markets after consolidation
- Requires clean price action - avoid choppy conditions
- Works best with liquid assets (forex majors, large cap stocks, BTC/ETH)

This strategy combines institutional flow analysis (liquidity clusters) with technical confirmation (Bollinger contraction) for high-probability breakouts with favorable risk/reward ratios.
