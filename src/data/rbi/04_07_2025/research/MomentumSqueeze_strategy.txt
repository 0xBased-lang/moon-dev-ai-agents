STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Breakout:** The strategy uses OBV to confirm strong buying pressure when it breaks above its 20-period EMA, signaling accumulation.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies low volatility periods where a breakout is imminent. The squeeze occurs when the bands narrow significantly.  
3. **Price Breakout Confirmation:** A long entry is triggered only when price closes above the upper Bollinger Band, confirming momentum.  
4. **Exit Signal:** The trade is closed when OBV reverses and drops below its 20-period EMA, indicating weakening momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Bands (20,2) are in a squeeze (bands narrowing to a predefined threshold).  
- **Condition 2:** OBV crosses and closes above its 20-period EMA.  
- **Condition 3:** Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Entry Action:** Go long on the next candle’s open if all conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Condition:** OBV crosses and closes below its 20-period EMA.  
- **Exit Action:** Close the position on the next candle’s open.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss below the recent swing low or the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Trailing Stop (Optional):** Use a trailing stop based on ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) to lock in profits if the trend extends.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To identify squeeze and breakout levels.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) with 20-period EMA** – To confirm volume-backed momentum.  
3. **Optional:** Average True Range (ATR) for dynamic stop placement.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid ranging conditions.  
- Backtest squeeze thresholds (e.g., band width percentile) for optimal performance.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for better accuracy.  

This strategy capitalizes on high-probability breakouts with volume confirmation, exiting before momentum fades.
