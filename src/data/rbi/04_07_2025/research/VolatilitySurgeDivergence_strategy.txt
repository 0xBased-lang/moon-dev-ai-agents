STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction, momentum divergence, and volume confirmation to identify high-probability long entries during potential trend reversals or accelerations.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - Measures volatility contraction when hitting 10-day lows
2. RSI Divergence - Identifies bullish momentum shifts against price action
3. Volume Surge - Confirms participation when exceeding 20-day average
4. ATR Trailing Stop - Provides dynamic exit mechanism based on volatility

Entry Rules (Long Only):
1. Primary Trigger: Bollinger Band Width (20,2) reaches 10-day low
2. Confirmation 1: Bullish RSI divergence (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low)
3. Confirmation 2: Current volume > 20-day volume average
4. All three conditions must align simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: 2x the 14-period ATR from entry price
2. Stop adjusts daily to lock in profits while allowing room for volatility
3. No fixed take-profit - lets winners run until stopped out

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk of capital
2. Stop distance determines position size (entry price - initial stop)
3. No pyramiding - single entry per setup
4. Time filter: Avoid entering last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for width calculation
2. RSI (14 period) - for divergence detection
3. Volume + 20-day SMA of volume
4. ATR (14 period) - for stop calculation

Optimization Notes:
1. Can test different BBW lookback periods (7-14 days)
2. RSI period could be adjusted (9-21)
3. ATR multiplier range (1.5-3) for stop sensitivity
4. Volume average period (10-30 days)

This strategy excels in transitioning markets where volatility compression precedes directional moves, with volume confirming institutional participation and RSI signaling hidden strength. The ATR-based exit adapts to changing market conditions while protecting gains.
