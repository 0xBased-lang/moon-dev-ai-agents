STRATEGY_NAME: FractalBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Heikin-Ashi Breakout Confirmation:** The strategy uses the smoothed price action of Heikin-Ashi candles to filter out noise and confirm trend direction.  
2. **Bollinger Band Volatility Expansion:** A breakout beyond the 2-standard deviation Bollinger Band signals extreme volatility and potential continuation.  
3. **Stochastic RSI Momentum Alignment:** The 1-hour Stochastic RSI crossover ensures momentum supports the breakout direction.  
4. **Fractal Volatility Anchoring:** Stops are placed at recent fractal highs/lows, which act as dynamic support/resistance zones based on market structure.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. 15-minute Heikin-Ashi candle closes *above* the upper 2σ Bollinger Band.  
  2. 1-hour Stochastic RSI (14,3,3) crosses *above* its signal line (bullish momentum).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. 15-minute Heikin-Ashi candle closes *below* the lower 2σ Bollinger Band.  
  2. 1-hour Stochastic RSI (14,3,3) crosses *below* its signal line (bearish momentum).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Trail stop using a fractal-based volatility zone (e.g., recent swing high/low).  
  - Alternatively, target 1:1 or 1:2 risk-reward ratio based on entry-to-stop distance.  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - For longs: Place stop below the most recent fractal low.  
  - For shorts: Place stop above the most recent fractal high.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk per trade: 1-2% of account capital.  
- Adjust position size based on stop distance to maintain consistent risk.  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (15-minute chart).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).  
3. Stochastic RSI (14,3,3 settings on 1-hour chart).  
4. Fractal indicator (to identify volatility zones for stops).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines smoothed price action (Heikin-Ashi) with volatility extremes (Bollinger Bands) and momentum confirmation (Stochastic RSI).  
- Uses fractal-based stops for adaptive risk management tied to market structure.  
- Focuses on high-probability breakouts with multi-timeframe alignment.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize parameters (e.g., Bollinger Band deviation, Stochastic RSI settings) for specific instruments.
