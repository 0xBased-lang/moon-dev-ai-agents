STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with money flow analysis and volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout trades from consolidation zones.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (10-day period) - Identifies contraction/consolidation phases when width narrows
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20-day period) - Confirms weakening momentum during consolidation
3. Volume Surge Filter - Requires 150% of 20-day average volume for entry confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Setup Condition: 
   - Bollinger Band width must be in bottom 30% of its 20-day range (indicating contraction)
   - Chaikin Money Flow must show declining trend over past 5 days
2. Trigger: 
   - Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band (for long) or below lower Band (for short)
   - Breakout must be accompanied by volume â‰¥150% of 20-day average
3. Execution: 
   - Enter on close of breakout candle
   - Stop placed at middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Take partial profits at 1.5x average true range (ATR)
   - Trail remaining position with 2x ATR trailing stop
2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop at middle Bollinger Band
   - If not hit, move to breakeven after 1.5x ATR profit reached

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk between entry and initial stop
2. Maximum 3 concurrent positions to avoid overconcentration
3. No trading during major economic news events to avoid false breakouts

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20-day)
3. Volume (20-day average)
4. Average True Range (14-day) for risk calculation

Optimization Notes:
- Works best on 1-hour or 4-hour charts for swing trades
- Most effective in trending markets after consolidation
- Test different Bollinger Band periods (10-20) for your instrument
- Adjust volume threshold (125-200%) based on asset liquidity

This VolSqueezeBreakout strategy combines the reliability of volatility contraction with money flow confirmation and volume validation, creating a high-probability breakout system with defined risk parameters.
