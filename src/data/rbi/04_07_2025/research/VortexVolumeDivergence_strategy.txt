STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator Crossover**: The strategy uses the Vortex Indicator (VI) to identify potential trend reversals. A long signal is triggered when the VI+ (positive trend) crosses above the VI- (negative trend), while a short signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+.  
2. **Volume Confirmation**: The crossover must be accompanied by declining volume, indicating weakening momentum in the current trend.  
3. **ADX Filter**: The Average Directional Index (ADX) must be below 20 to confirm a lack of strong trend, ensuring trades are taken in range-bound or consolidating markets. Exits occur if ADX rises above 25, signaling the start of a strong trend.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: VI+ crosses above VI- AND volume is declining AND ADX < 20.  
- **Short Entry**: VI- crosses above VI+ AND volume is declining AND ADX < 20.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: VI- crosses above VI+ OR ADX rises above 25.  
- **Short Exit**: VI+ crosses above VI- OR ADX rises above 25.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: A fixed percentage or ATR-based stop-loss can be applied to limit downside risk.  
2. **Position Sizing**: Adjust position size based on volatility (e.g., using ATR) to ensure consistent risk per trade.  
3. **Time-Based Exit**: Consider exiting trades if no significant movement occurs within a predefined timeframe (e.g., 3-5 bars).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI)**: Comprising VI+ and VI- lines for trend direction.  
2. **Volume**: To confirm weakening momentum.  
3. **Average Directional Index (ADX)**: To filter out strong trending markets.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines Vortex crossovers with volume divergence for higher-probability reversals.  
- Uses ADX as a dynamic filter to avoid trading in strong trends.  
- Exits are based on both inverse crossovers and ADX strength, capturing early trend changes.  

This strategy is ideal for range-bound markets and avoids false signals in strong trends, making it a "VortexVolumeDivergence" approach.
