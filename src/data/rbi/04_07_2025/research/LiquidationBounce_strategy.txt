STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBounce  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines technical analysis with on-chain liquidation data to identify potential reversal opportunities. The core premise is that when price reaches oversold conditions (lower Bollinger Band) while liquidation clusters exceed their 30-day average, it signals excessive market stress that may lead to a corrective bounce.  

Key Components:  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)  
2. On-chain liquidation cluster data (30-day moving average)  
3. Price action confirmation at lower band  

Entry Rules:  
- Price must touch or penetrate the lower Bollinger Band  
- Concurrent on-chain liquidation clusters must be above their 30-day average  
- Entry occurs on the next candle's open after both conditions are met  

Exit Rules:  
- Take profit at middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)  
- Stop loss placed at 1.5x the distance between entry and lower band  
- Time-based exit if middle band isn't reached within 5 periods  

Risk Management:  
- Position size limited to 2% of capital per trade  
- Stop loss mandatory on all positions  
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur  

Required Indicators:  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)  
2. Custom liquidation cluster indicator (30-day MA)  
3. Simple Moving Average (20-period) for middle band  

Optimization Notes:  
- Test different Bollinger Band periods (14-26)  
- Experiment with liquidation threshold multiples (1.2x-2x average)  
- Adjust stop loss multiplier based on volatility (ATR can be added)  

This strategy works best in ranging or mean-reverting markets and may underperform during strong trending conditions. The combination of technical oversold signals with on-chain stress indicators provides a unique confluence for potential reversals.
