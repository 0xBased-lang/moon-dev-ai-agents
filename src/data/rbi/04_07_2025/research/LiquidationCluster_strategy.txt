STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationCluster  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Hunting Focus:** The strategy capitalizes on potential liquidation cascades by identifying key price levels where stop losses are likely clustered.  
2. **VWAP Cluster Breach:** Uses the weekly Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a critical level, where a breach signals potential liquidity grabs.  
3. **Funding Rate Spike:** Confirms bearish bias when futures funding rates spike, indicating excessive long leverage vulnerable to liquidation.  
4. **Volume-Weighted Zones:** Exits are based on the next significant volume-based support/resistance zone, ensuring trades capture the liquidity-driven move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger:** Price closes below the weekly VWAP cluster level (aggregate of multiple VWAPs or a key VWAP level).  
- **Confirmation:** Simultaneous spike in futures funding rates (e.g., > 0.1% or 2x the 7-day average).  
- **Execution:** Enter short on the next candle after confirmation, with a limit order near the breach level to avoid slippage.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Next major volume-weighted support/resistance zone (e.g., prior high-volume node or VWAP from a lower timeframe).  
- **Stop Loss:** Place above the recent swing high or the weekly VWAP cluster breach level, whichever is tighter.  
- **Early Exit:** If funding rates normalize sharply (drop below baseline), consider partial or full exit.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size based on the distance to stop-loss (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., weekends, holidays).  
- Monitor open interest changes: A drop alongside price breach strengthens the liquidation thesis.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Weekly VWAP (and cluster analysis if using multiple VWAPs).  
2. Futures funding rate data (preferably perpetual swaps).  
3. Volume-profile or volume-weighted zones (e.g., VPOC, volume nodes).  
4. Optional: Open interest tracker to confirm liquidation flows.  

**Note:** This strategy thrives in high-leverage crypto markets where liquidations amplify price moves. Backtest for asset-specific VWAP sensitivity and funding rate thresholds.
