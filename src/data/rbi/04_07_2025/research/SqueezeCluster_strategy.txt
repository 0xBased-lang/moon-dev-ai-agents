STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeCluster  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility where price is consolidating, often preceding significant breakouts.  
2. **Liquidation Heatmap Clusters:** Pinpoints areas where high liquidity (and potential stop-loss orders) are clustered, indicating zones where price may accelerate upon breakout.  
3. **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Uses a percentile-based threshold to exit trades when volatility spikes, capturing the momentum phase before potential reversals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - Bollinger Band width (BBW) is below its 20-period average (indicating a squeeze).  
  - Price is near a liquidation cluster (heatmap shows dense liquidity zone below current price).  
- **Short Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - BBW is below its 20-period average.  
  - Price is near a liquidation cluster (heatmap shows dense liquidity zone above current price).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Close position when:  
  - BBW expands above the 90th percentile of its 30-day range (indicating high volatility).  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** Set at the opposite side of the liquidation cluster (e.g., below cluster for longs, above for shorts).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on distance to liquidation cluster (wider clusters allow larger positions).  
- Hard stop-loss at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the past 14 periods.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + BBW (Bollinger Band Width).  
2. Liquidation Heatmap (external data source or footprint chart analysis).  
3. Volatility Percentile (30-day BBW range calculation).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with liquidity-driven momentum, targeting high-probability breakouts while avoiding false signals with percentile-based exits.
