STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Strength Confirmation:** Uses ADX (Average Directional Index) above 25 to ensure strong trending conditions.  
2. **Volume Divergence:** OBV (On-Balance Volume) divergence confirms underlying strength/weakness in price action.  
3. **Retracement Entry:** Entries are triggered when price retraces to the 20-period VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price), acting as a dynamic support/resistance level.  
4. **Dynamic Risk Management:** Stop-loss is set at 1.5x the 14-period ATR (Average True Range) to account for volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - ADX > 25 (confirming strong trend).  
  - Bullish OBV divergence (price makes lower low, OBV makes higher low).  
  - Price retraces to touch or approach the 20-period VWAP.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - ADX > 25 (confirming strong trend).  
  - Bearish OBV divergence (price makes higher high, OBV makes lower high).  
  - Price retraces to touch or approach the 20-period VWAP.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take-Profit:** No fixed target; trail stop or exit when OBV shows reversal signs (e.g., divergence against price).  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Long trades: Stop placed at 1.5x ATR below the entry candle’s low.  
  - Short trades: Stop placed at 1.5x ATR above the entry candle’s high.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing adjusts based on stop distance (e.g., risk 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low ADX (<25) or choppy market conditions.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. ADX (14-period default).  
2. OBV (On-Balance Volume).  
3. 20-period VWAP.  
4. 14-period ATR for stop placement.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets (ADX confirmation critical).  
- OBV divergence adds conviction to retracement entries.  
- ATR-based stops adapt to volatility, reducing premature exits.  

This strategy combines trend, volume, and price action for high-probability setups while dynamically managing risk.
