STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Ratio Filter:** Uses the 3-day ATR divided by the 20-day ATR to identify low volatility conditions (ratio < 0.5).  
2. **Keltner Channel Breakout:** Enters long when price breaks above the upper Keltner Channel band, signaling a potential breakout.  
3. **Trailing Stop Exit:** Uses a 2x ATR trailing stop to lock in profits and manage risk dynamically.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The 3-day volatility ratio (current ATR / 20-day ATR) must be below 0.5, indicating compressed volatility.  
- **Condition 2:** Price must break above the upper Keltner Channel band (typically set at 2x ATR around a 20-period EMA).  
- **Action:** Enter long on the breakout confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit the trade when price retraces 2x the current ATR from the highest point reached since entry.  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** A hard stop-loss can be placed at 1x ATR below entry for additional risk control.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be based on the ATR to ensure risk per trade is consistent (e.g., 1% risk per trade).  
- Avoid entering during high volatility (volatility ratio > 0.5) to reduce false breakouts.  
- Trade only in the direction of the broader trend (optional filter: 50 EMA slope can be used for trend confirmation).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ATR (Average True Range):** 3-day and 20-day periods for volatility ratio calculation.  
2. **Keltner Channel:** 20-period EMA with upper/lower bands set at 2x ATR.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging markets where volatility compression precedes breakouts.  
- Backtest for optimal ATR multiplier (e.g., 1.5x or 2x) based on asset characteristics.  
- Combine with volume confirmation for higher probability setups.  

This strategy capitalizes on low-volatility breakouts while using ATR-based stops to manage risk effectively.
