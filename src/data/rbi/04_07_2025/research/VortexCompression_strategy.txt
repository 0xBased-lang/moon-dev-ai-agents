STRATEGY_NAME: VortexCompression  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Tracks directional movement (VI+ for bullish, VI- for bearish).  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires accelerating volume (e.g., volume > SMA(volume, 20)) to validate VI crossovers.  
3. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Measures volatility compression (Bandwidth < SMA(Bandwidth, 50)) to filter low-noise setups.  
4. **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Monitors Bandwidth expansion or opposing VI crossover for exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** VI+ crosses above VI- *and* volume > SMA(volume, 20) *and* Bollinger Bandwidth < SMA(Bandwidth, 50).  
- **Short Entry:** VI- crosses above VI+ *and* volume > SMA(volume, 20) *and* Bollinger Bandwidth < SMA(Bandwidth, 50).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** VI- crosses above VI+ *or* Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond SMA(Bandwidth, 50).  
- **Short Exit:** VI+ crosses above VI- *or* Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond SMA(Bandwidth, 50).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry.  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk â‰¤ 1% of capital per trade.  
- **Time Filter:** Avoid trading during first/last 30 minutes of session to reduce noise.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. Volume (with 20-period SMA for acceleration filter).  
3. Bollinger Bandwidth (50-period SMA for contraction threshold).  
4. ATR (14-period for stop-loss calculation).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend (VI), volume conviction, and volatility cycles for high-probability reversals/breakouts. Avoids choppy markets via Bandwidth contraction.
