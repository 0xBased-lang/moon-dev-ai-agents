STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation cluster analysis with RSI reversal signals to identify high-probability counter-trend opportunities. The approach focuses on extreme liquidity zones where forced position closures create potential reversal points.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Analysis (4H timeframe)
   - Tracks historical liquidation levels
   - Identifies when current clusters exceed 90th percentile of historical data
   - Suggests potential exhaustion points in the trend

2. RSI Reversal Signal (1H timeframe)
   - Uses standard 14-period RSI
   - Requires reversal from oversold (<30) for long entries
   - Requires reversal from overbought (>70) for short entries

Entry Rules:
- LONG ENTRY:
  1. 4H liquidation cluster exceeds 90th percentile historical level
  2. 1H RSI crosses above 30 from below (reversal from oversold)
  3. Enter on confirmation candle close

- SHORT ENTRY:
  1. 4H liquidation cluster exceeds 90th percentile historical level
  2. 1H RSI crosses below 70 from above (reversal from overbought)
  3. Enter on confirmation candle close

Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: 20-period EMA (closing price crosses opposite side of EMA)
- Secondary Exit: Fixed 1:2 risk-reward ratio from entry point
- Emergency Exit: If price moves against position by 2x initial stop distance

Risk Management:
- Initial stop placed at recent swing low (longs) or swing high (shorts)
- Position size calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (requires strategy review)

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation cluster heatmap (4H)
2. RSI (14-period, 1H)
3. EMA (20-period, same timeframe as entry)

Additional Notes:
- Best performed in high-liquidity markets (major forex pairs, BTC, ETH)
- Requires confirmation between liquidation extremes and RSI signals
- Avoid trading during major news events that may disrupt normal liquidity patterns
- Works particularly well after extended trends when liquidation levels become extreme

Optimization Tips:
- Backtest different RSI periods (12-16) for specific instruments
- Experiment with EMA lengths (15-25) for exit sensitivity
- Consider adding volume confirmation for higher probability setups
