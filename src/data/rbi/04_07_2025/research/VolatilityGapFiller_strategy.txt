STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityGapFiller

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines dynamic volatility analysis with volume profile gaps to identify high-probability breakout trades with defined risk parameters.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Threshold: Uses Bollinger Band width percentile (20-period lookback) to determine when volatility expansion reaches significant levels (typically >70th percentile)
2. Volume Profile Analysis: Identifies liquidity gaps in the volume profile (areas with minimal trading activity)
3. Fractal-based Trailing: Uses recent fractal highs/lows (5-period fractal) for dynamic stop placement

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Price closes outside Bollinger Bands while BB width is above 70th percentile
2. Confirmation: Volume profile shows clear liquidity gap in direction of breakout
3. Execution: Enter on retest of breakout level or next candle open

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Initial target at 50% gap fill level, final target at full gap fill
2. Trailing Stop: Activates after hitting 1.5x initial risk:
   - Longs: Trail below most recent fractal low
   - Shorts: Trail above most recent fractal high
3. Emergency Exit: Close position if BB width drops below 30th percentile

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial Stop: 
   - Longs: Below most recent swing low or fractal low
   - Shorts: Above most recent swing high or fractal high
3. Maximum Drawdown: 5% daily, 15% weekly circuit breaker

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width percentile calculation
2. Volume Profile (200-period lookback)
3. Fractal Indicator (5-period)
4. ATR (14) for volatility context

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust BB width percentile thresholds based on asset class (70-80% for stocks, 60-70% for forex)
- Gap fill targets work best on 1H-4H timeframes
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for improved win rate

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear volume profile structures, using volatility expansion as the catalyst for breakout trades with well-defined risk parameters.
