STRATEGY_NAME: BandFlow Accumulator

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band mean-reversion with Chaikin Money Flow confirmation to identify high-probability accumulation points during oversold conditions.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
2. Chaikin Money Flow (21-period standard setting)
3. Price action analysis for swing low identification

Entry Rules:
1. Price must touch or cross below the lower Bollinger Band
2. Chaikin Money Flow must cross above zero line on same candle
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously for valid entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary take-profit at middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
2. Alternative exit if Chaikin Money Flow crosses below zero before reaching middle band

Risk Management:
1. Stop-loss placed at most recent swing low (must be below entry price)
2. Position size calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
3. No entries if stop distance exceeds 2x average true range (ATR)

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 period, 2 standard deviations
- Chaikin Money Flow: 21 period standard
- Optional: 14-period ATR for risk sizing

Additional Rules:
1. Only trade in direction of higher timeframe trend (for swing trades)
2. Avoid trading during major news events
3. Minimum 1:1.5 risk-reward ratio required
4. Wait for candle close to confirm signals

This strategy works best in ranging markets and requires confirmation from both volatility (Bollinger Bands) and money flow indicators to filter out false breakdowns. The combination provides a systematic approach to catching oversold bounces with institutional accumulation confirmation.
