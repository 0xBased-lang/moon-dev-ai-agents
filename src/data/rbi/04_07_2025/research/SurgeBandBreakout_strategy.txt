STRATEGY_NAME: SurgeBand Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume surge detection with Bollinger Band breakouts for high-probability trade entries. The unique combination of volume confirmation and volatility-based price thresholds creates a powerful filter for significant market moves.

Key Components:
1. Volume Surge Filter (200% above 20-day average)
2. Bollinger Band Breakout (close outside bands)
3. Time-based exit (48-hour maximum hold)
4. Band-reversion exit (price returns inside bands)

Entry Rules:
1. Calculate 20-day average volume
2. Wait for current volume to exceed 200% of this average
3. Confirm price closes outside Bollinger Bands (either upper or lower)
4. Enter long if above upper band, short if below lower band

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Price closes back inside Bollinger Bands
2. Secondary Exit: 48 hours elapse from entry (time-based stop)
3. (Optional) Trailing stop can be added at 2x Bollinger Band width

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (wider bands = smaller position)
2. Hard stop-loss at opposite band (for long: lower band, for short: upper band)
3. Maximum capital allocation per trade: 2% of portfolio
4. Daily volume filter prevents over-trading in low-liquidity conditions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume indicator with 20-day average
3. Time-based exit counter
4. (Optional) ATR for additional volatility measurement

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different volume thresholds (150-250%)
2. Experiment with band periods (14-26 days)
3. Adjust standard deviation multiplier (1.5-2.5)
4. Consider adding RSI filter for overbought/oversold conditions

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear volatility expansions, while the volume filter helps avoid false breakouts. The 48-hour timeout prevents excessive drawdown during ranging periods.
