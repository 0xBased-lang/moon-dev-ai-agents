STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the trend-following capabilities of the Vortex Indicator with volume confirmation for high-probability entries, using an adaptive trailing stop for exits.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines) - measures trend direction and strength
2. Volume analysis - confirms breakout validity
3. ATR-based trailing stop - dynamic risk management

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VI+ (positive trend indicator) must cross above VI- (negative trend indicator)
2. Confirmation: Volume must surge at least 20% above the 5-day moving average
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously on the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing stop set at 3x the 14-period Average True Range (ATR)
2. Stop moves with favorable price movement
3. No profit targets - let the trailing stop capture the full trend

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk of capital
2. Initial stop set at 3x ATR from entry
3. No re-entry until new signal forms after stop-out

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (standard 14-period setting)
2. Volume indicator with 5-day moving average
3. Average True Range (14-period)

Special Considerations:
- Best suited for 1-hour charts or higher timeframes
- Works particularly well in trending markets
- Volume surge helps filter false breakouts
- ATR trailing stop adapts to market volatility

Optimization Tips:
- Test different ATR multiples (2.5x-3.5x) for stop
- Adjust volume threshold (15-25%) based on instrument
- Combine with fundamental trends for higher accuracy

This VortexVolumeSurge strategy provides a systematic approach to capturing strong trends with volume confirmation, while the ATR-based stop ensures optimal risk-reward ratios.
