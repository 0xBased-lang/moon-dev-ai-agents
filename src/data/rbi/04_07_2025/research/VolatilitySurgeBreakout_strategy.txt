STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility compression followed by explosive breakouts, combining Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels with volume confirmation and RSI-based exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Squeeze Detection:
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2) and Keltner Channels (20,1.5) must converge
   - Squeeze confirmed when Bollinger Bands are inside Keltner Channels

2. Breakout Confirmation:
   - Price must close outside both Bollinger Bands AND Keltner Channels
   - Volume must surge 150% above 20-period average volume

3. Exit Signal:
   - 5-period RSI crossing below 70 (long exit) or above 30 (short exit)
   - Alternative exit when price re-enters Keltner Channel
