STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines EMA crossover signals with Bollinger Band squeeze detection
- Incorporates volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Uses a fast EMA period (2) for responsive entries
- Bollinger Band parameters (20-day SMA with 2.5Ïƒ) identify volatility contraction
- Volume surge (above 50-day average) confirms participation

2. Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- 2-period EMA crosses above previous EMA
- Bollinger Band width is at recent lows (squeeze condition)
- Current volume > 50-day average volume
- All three conditions must occur simultaneously

SHORT ENTRY:
- 2-period EMA crosses below previous EMA
- Bollinger Band width is at recent lows (squeeze condition)
- Current volume > 50-day average volume
- All three conditions must occur simultaneously

3. Exit Rules:
- Close long position when 2-period EMA crosses below previous EMA
- Close short position when 2-period EMA crosses above previous EMA
- Alternative exit: 1% profit target (optional)

4. Risk Management:
- Recommended stop-loss: 1% below entry for longs, 1% above for shorts
- Position sizing should account for volatility (consider ATR-based sizing)
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false squeezes

5. Required Indicators:
- 2-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2.5 standard deviations)
- 50-day simple moving average of volume
- Volume indicator (current period)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on liquid assets with consistent volatility patterns
- Timeframe recommendation: 15min to 4hr charts
- Backtest suggested to optimize squeeze detection parameters
- Combine with price action confirmation for higher accuracy
- The strategy capitalizes on volatility expansion following contraction periods
