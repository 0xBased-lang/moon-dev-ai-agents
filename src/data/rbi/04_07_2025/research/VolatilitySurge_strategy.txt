STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Filter:** Uses 20-day historical volatility to identify low-volatility conditions (below the 10th percentile).  
2. **Trend Confirmation:** Requires price to cross above the 200-day moving average (long-term trend filter).  
3. **Risk-Managed Exits:** Implements a 2x ATR (Average True Range) trailing stop-loss and a fixed 5% profit target.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - 20-day historical volatility falls below its 10th percentile (indicating suppressed volatility).  
  - Price closes above the 200-day moving average (confirming bullish trend alignment).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Trailing stop set at 2x the 14-day ATR to account for volatility expansion.  
- **Profit Target:** Fixed 5% take-profit level from the entry price.  
- **Optional Exit:** If volatility spikes above a predefined threshold (e.g., 90th percentile), consider closing to avoid reversals.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on ATR (e.g., 1% risk per trade).  
- Avoid entries during high-volatility regimes (e.g., above 50th percentile).  
- Re-enter only after volatility resets below the 10th percentile again.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 20-day historical volatility (percentile-based).  
2. 200-day simple moving average (SMA).  
3. 14-day Average True Range (ATR) for stop-loss.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines mean-reverting volatility signals with trend-following filters, targeting "quiet before the storm" setups where low volatility often precedes strong directional moves.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize volatility percentiles and ATR multipliers for specific assets.
