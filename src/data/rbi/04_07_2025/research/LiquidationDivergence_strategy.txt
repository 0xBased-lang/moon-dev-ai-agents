STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation cluster analysis with RSI divergence and Bollinger Band exits for high-probability crypto reversal trades.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Analysis (2σ threshold)
2. RSI Divergence (14-period standard)
3. Bollinger Band (20,2 standard settings) exit trigger

Entry Rules:
1. Identify when liquidation clusters exceed 2 standard deviations from the 30-day mean
2. Confirm bearish RSI divergence (price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high) for short entries
3. Confirm bullish RSI divergence (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low) for long entries
4. Enter on first candle close confirming the divergence pattern

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Exit when price touches upper Bollinger Band
2. For short positions: Exit when price touches lower Bollinger Band
3. Optional: Partial exit (50%) at opposite Bollinger Band midline

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placement:
   - Longs: Below recent swing low
   - Shorts: Above recent swing high
3. Maximum daily trades: 3 to prevent overtrading

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation cluster data (from exchange API or specialized platform)
2. RSI (14 period)
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
4. 30-day moving average of liquidation clusters
5. Standard deviation calculation for liquidation clusters

Additional Notes:
- Best applied to major crypto pairs with sufficient liquidity
- Most effective on 4h or daily timeframes
- Requires monitoring of funding rates to confirm liquidation potential
- Works best when combined with volume confirmation
- Avoid trading during major news events that may distort liquidation patterns

Optimization Tips:
- Test different RSI periods (7-21) for your trading pair
- Experiment with 1.5σ-2.5σ thresholds for liquidation clusters
- Consider adding MACD confirmation for stronger signals
- Backtest different Bollinger Band settings (18-22 period, 1.8-2.2 deviations)
