STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI)**: Comprises two lines (VI+ and VI-) that measure trend direction and strength. A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-, while a bearish signal occurs when VI+ crosses below VI-.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Divergence**: Confirms trend reversals when price makes a higher high but OBV makes a lower high (bearish divergence) or price makes a lower low but OBV makes a higher low (bullish divergence).  
3. **Dynamic Trailing Stop**: Uses volatility bands (e.g., ATR-based or Bollinger Bands) to adjust stop-loss levels based on recent market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish vortex signal).  
  - Price makes a higher low, but OBV makes a higher high (bullish divergence confirmation).  
- **Short Entry**:  
  - VI+ crosses below VI- (bearish vortex signal).  
  - Price makes a lower high, but OBV makes a lower low (bearish divergence confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop**: Adjusts dynamically based on volatility (e.g., 2x ATR or Bollinger Band width).  
  - For long positions, trail stop below the lower volatility band.  
  - For short positions, trail stop above the upper volatility band.  
- **Manual Exit**: If OBV shows early divergence against the current position (e.g., OBV weakening while price continues).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Initial stop-loss placed at the recent swing low (long) or swing high (short).  
- Position sizing based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low volatility (e.g., when ATR is below a threshold).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)** – Default period (14).  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)** – Confirms divergence.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR) or Bollinger Bands** – For dynamic trailing stop.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different VI lookback periods (e.g., 10-20).  
- Adjust OBV sensitivity by pairing it with price swings (e.g., 2-3 candle confirmation).  
- Fine-tune trailing stop multiplier (e.g., 1.5x-3x ATR).  

This strategy combines trend-following (Vortex) with volume-based confirmation (OBV divergence) while using adaptive risk management for exits.
