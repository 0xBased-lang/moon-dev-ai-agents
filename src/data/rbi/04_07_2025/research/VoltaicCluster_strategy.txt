STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicCluster  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Chaikin Volatility Indicator**: Measures the rate of price change (volatility expansion/contraction) by comparing the high-low range to exponential moving averages.  
2. **Liquidation Cluster Zones**: Identified via order book delta imbalances (large buy/sell order clusters that indicate potential liquidation levels).  
3. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: Used to define exit points based on price retracements from recent swings.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long when:  
  - Chaikin Volatility expands sharply (e.g., crosses above a predefined threshold).  
  - Price approaches a liquidation cluster zone with a bullish delta imbalance (more buy orders absorbed).  
- Enter short when:  
  - Chaikin Volatility expands sharply.  
  - Price approaches a liquidation cluster zone with a bearish delta imbalance (more sell orders absorbed).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take profit when:  
  - Chaikin Volatility contracts (falls below a threshold).  
  - Price reaches a key Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 1.618).  
- Stop loss when:  
  - Price retraces beyond a Fibonacci level (e.g., 61.8% of the recent swing).  
  - Liquidation cluster zone is invalidated (order book delta reverses).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-adjusted).  
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital.  
- Trailing stops activated after volatility peaks (Chaikin begins to contract).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Chaikin Volatility Indicator.  
2. Order Book Delta (real-time liquidity data).  
3. Fibonacci Retracement Tool.  
4. Optional: ATR for dynamic position sizing.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility signals with liquidity-based zones for high-probability entries.  
- Uses Fibonacci levels for precision exits rather than fixed take-profit/stop-loss.  
- Adaptive to market conditions via Chaikinâ€™s volatility thresholds.  

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear liquidity imbalances and is best applied on higher timeframes (1H+).
