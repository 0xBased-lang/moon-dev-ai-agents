STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume confirmation with extreme price positioning within Bollinger Bands to identify potential reversal opportunities. The key components are:

1. INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- On-Balance Volume (OBV) - 10-day period
- Bollinger Bands - 20-day period with standard settings (20,2)
- Price percentile calculation within Bollinger Bands

2. ENTRY RULES:
- OBV must reach a 10-day high (showing strong buying pressure)
- Price must simultaneously be in the lower 20th percentile of its 20-day Bollinger Band (indicating oversold conditions)
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously to trigger a long entry

3. EXIT RULES:
- Close position when price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band
- Alternative exit: Consider exiting if OBV drops below its 5-day moving average

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Recommended stop-loss: Below the recent swing low or below the lower Bollinger Band
- Position sizing should account for the volatility indicated by the Bollinger Band width
- Avoid trading during periods of extremely narrow bands (low volatility)

5. KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Works best in ranging or mildly trending markets
- May generate false signals during strong downtrends
- Volume confirmation helps filter out weak bounces
- Best used on daily or 4-hour timeframes for reliable signals

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Adjust OBV period based on market volatility (shorter for more active markets)
- Consider adding a momentum filter (e.g., RSI > 30) for additional confirmation
- Test different percentile thresholds (15th-25th) for price positioning

This strategy capitalizes on the divergence between strong volume accumulation and depressed price levels, with Bollinger Bands providing clear exit points when the price becomes overextended.
