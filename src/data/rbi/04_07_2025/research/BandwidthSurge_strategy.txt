STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Breakout:** The strategy identifies breakouts when the Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 6-month low, indicating a period of extreme compression and potential volatility expansion.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a surge in trading volume exceeding the 50-day average, ensuring strong participation in the move.  
3. **Low ADX Filter:** The ADX (Average Directional Index) must be below 20, confirming a lack of strong trend and increasing the likelihood of a new trend emerging from the breakout.  
4. **Parabolic SAR Exit:** Trailing stops using the Parabolic SAR indicator are employed to lock in profits and exit trades when the trend reverses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  1. Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 6-month low (indicating compression).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds the 50-day average volume.  
  4. ADX is below 20 (confirming low trend strength).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the trade when the Parabolic SAR flips below the price (for long positions), signaling a potential trend reversal.  
- Alternatively, set a fixed stop-loss (e.g., 2-3% below entry) to manage risk in case of false breakouts.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be conservative (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade) due to the volatility of breakouts.  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods to reduce false signals.  
- Monitor the Parabolic SAR closely for timely exits.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) + Bandwidth calculation.  
2. Volume (50-day average for comparison).  
3. ADX (14-period, threshold at 20).  
4. Parabolic SAR (default settings: 0.02 step, 0.2 maximum).  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy excels in ranging markets where Bollinger Bandwidth compression precedes explosive moves.  
- Backtest for optimal ADX threshold and volume multiplier adjustments.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., candle closes above BB) for higher accuracy.  

**Name Justification:** "BandwidthSurge" reflects the core mechanics: Bollinger Bandwidth contraction ("Bandwidth") and volume surge confirmation ("Surge"), making it distinct from generic breakout strategies.
