STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterConvergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility clustering phenomena by combining liquidation heatmap analysis with implied volatility rank (IVR) metrics for precise timing in high-volatility environments.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Heatmap - Identifies price levels with concentrated liquidation potential
2. Implied Volatility Rank (IVR) - Measures current IV relative to its historical range (0-100)
3. Volatility Clusters - Periods where high volatility tends to persist

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: 
   - IVR > 70 (indicating top 30% of historical implied volatility)
   - Price approaches key liquidation zone on heatmap
   - Convergence occurs when liquidation zone aligns with high IVR

2. Confirmation:
   - Increasing trading volume in the direction of anticipated move
   - Price rejection from liquidation zone (wick formation)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - When price reaches next liquidation zone in profit direction
   - IVR drops below 40 (volatility normalization)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Close position if price moves beyond initial liquidation zone against position
   - IVR spikes above 90 (indicating potential volatility exhaustion)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - 1-2% risk per trade based on distance to stop level
   - Reduced size during extreme IVR (>85) conditions

2. Volatility Adjustments:
   - Wider stops during high IVR periods
   - Tighter profit targets when IVR begins declining

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation Heatmap (cluster analysis)
2. Implied Volatility Rank (IVR)
3. Volume Profile
4. Price Action Patterns (for confirmation)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in crypto and high-beta assets
- Requires monitoring of macro volatility triggers
- Most effective during regime shifts or event-driven markets
- Avoid ranging markets with low IVR (<30)

The VolClusterConvergence strategy provides a systematic approach to trading volatility clusters by combining order flow analysis (liquidation zones) with volatility regime assessment (IVR), creating high-probability entries during periods of market stress or expansion.
