STRATEGY_NAME: VortexBand Synergy

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the directional confirmation of the Vortex Indicator (VI) with Bollinger Band volatility dynamics to identify high-probability trend-following opportunities. The system focuses on alignment between trend direction and volatility expansion phases.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) - Uses VI+ and VI- lines to determine trend direction
2. Bollinger Bands - Measures volatility contraction/expansion through band width
3. Price Action - Confirms breakouts from Bollinger Band boundaries

Entry Rules (Long):
1. VI+ must cross above VI- (bullish confirmation)
2. Bollinger Band width must be expanding from prior contraction
3. Price must close above upper Bollinger Band
4. All conditions must occur simultaneously

Entry Rules (Short):
1. VI- must cross above VI+ (bearish confirmation)
2. Bollinger Band width must be expanding from prior contraction
3. Price must close below lower Bollinger Band
4. All conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: VI- crosses above VI+ OR Bollinger Band width contracts significantly
2. For short positions: VI+ crosses above VI- OR Bollinger Band width contracts significantly
3. Optional trailing stop can be set at opposite Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
3. Stop moved to breakeven when price moves 1.5x ATR in profit
4. Maximum trade duration of 5 days to avoid whipsaws

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (standard 14-period)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
3. Optional: ATR (14-period) for stop placement

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 1-hour to daily timeframes
2. Works well in trending markets, less effective in ranging conditions
3. VI period can be adjusted between 10-20 periods based on asset volatility
4. Bollinger Band parameters can be optimized between 1.5-2.5 standard deviations

This strategy capitalizes on the synergy between confirmed trend direction and volatility expansion, providing a robust framework for capturing sustained price movements while filtering out false breakouts.
