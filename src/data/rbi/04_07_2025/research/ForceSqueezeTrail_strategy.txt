STRATEGY_NAME: ForceSqueezeTrail  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Elder Force Index (EFI):** A momentum indicator combining price movement and volume to measure the strength behind price moves. A cross above zero signals increasing bullish momentum.  
2. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Measures the narrowing of Bollinger Bands, indicating reduced volatility and potential for a breakout.  
3. **ATR Trailing Stop:** Uses 2x the Average True Range (ATR) to dynamically trail stops, locking in profits while allowing room for volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **long** when:  
  - EFI crosses **above zero** (bullish momentum confirmation).  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth is in contraction (current value below its 20-period SMA, or below a fixed threshold like 0.5).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit when price falls **2x ATR** from the highest high since entry.  
- Optional: Add a time-based exit (e.g., close after 10 bars if stop isnâ€™t hit).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade.  
- Initial stop loss can be set at 1x ATR below entry for tighter risk control.  
- Avoid entries during wide Bollinger Bandwidth (high volatility).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Elder Force Index (default 13-period).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 StdDev) + Bandwidth (calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  
3. Average True Range (14-period for ATR trailing stop).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines momentum (EFI) with volatility contraction (Bollinger Squeeze) for high-probability breakouts, while the ATR trailing stop adapts to market conditions.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize EFI period, Bandwidth threshold, and ATR multiplier for your asset/timeframe.
