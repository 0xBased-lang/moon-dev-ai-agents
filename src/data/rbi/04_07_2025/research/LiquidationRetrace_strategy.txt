STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationRetrace  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on post-liquidation market retracements by taking contrarian positions when price moves significantly away from the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). The approach is designed to exploit overextended price movements that often occur after liquidations, with well-defined entry and exit criteria.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):** Acts as the baseline for identifying deviations.  
2. **15-minute ATR (Average True Range):** Measures volatility to determine the threshold for entry.  
3. **Deviation Multiplier (3x ATR):** Triggers contrarian trades when price moves 3 times the 15-minute ATR away from VWAP.  
4. **Exit Conditions:**  
   - **50% Retracement:** Close the trade if price retraces halfway back to VWAP.  
   - **1-Hour Timeout:** Exit the trade if the retracement doesnâ€™t occur within one hour.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **long** if price drops **3x 15-minute ATR below VWAP**.  
- Go **short** if price rises **3x 15-minute ATR above VWAP**.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take profit when price retraces **50% of the initial deviation** (e.g., if price moved 3 ATR down, exit after a 1.5 ATR rebound).  
- Exit the trade after **1 hour** if no retracement occurs, to avoid prolonged exposure.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the volatility (ATR) to avoid excessive risk.  
- Stop-loss can be placed slightly beyond the 3x ATR deviation point to protect against further adverse moves.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods where retracements may be less reliable.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. VWAP  
2. 15-minute ATR  
3. Time-based exit (1-hour countdown)  

This strategy is best suited for volatile assets with frequent liquidation events (e.g., crypto, forex majors, or indices). It relies on mean reversion principles but incorporates strict timing and volatility-based filters to improve edge.
