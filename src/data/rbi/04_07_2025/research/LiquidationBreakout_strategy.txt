STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines on-chain liquidation data with technical volatility expansion to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The approach focuses on areas where clustered liquidations create potential price acceleration zones, confirmed by abnormal volatility expansion.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Detection (On-Chain):
   - Identify price levels with high concentration of liquidations (long/short)
   - Use platforms like Glassnode or Coinalyze to find liquidation heatmaps
   - Focus on zones within 2-3% of current price

2. Volatility Confirmation (Technical):
   - Keltner Channel (20-period, 2x ATR multiplier)
   - Monitor channel width expansion beyond 2x 20-day average
   - Use 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes for optimal signals

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Entry:
   - Price approaches identified liquidation cluster zone (Â±1.5%)
   - Keltner Channel width expands to >2x 20-day average
   - Enter on breakout of local high/low (for long/short respectively)
   - Use 15-minute closing confirmation

2. Secondary Entry:
   - Retest of breakout level after initial move
   - Channel width remains above 1.5x average
   - Reduced position size

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - 1:1.5 risk-reward ratio minimum
   - Partial profits at 1:1 (50% position)
   - Trail remainder using 1.5x ATR from extreme

2. Stop Loss:
   - Fixed: Opposite side of liquidation cluster
   - Dynamic: 1x ATR from entry for tighter risk
   - Whichever is closer to entry price

Risk Management:
- Maximum 2% capital per trade
- Daily loss limit of 5%
- Weekly loss limit of 10%
- Avoid trading during scheduled news events
- Reduce size by 50% during low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channel (20,2)
2. ATR (14-period)
3. On-chain liquidation heatmap
4. Volume profile (for confirmation)

Optimization Notes:
- Best results on BTC, ETH and high-cap alts
- Higher timeframe (4h+) reduces false signals
- Combine with RSI(14) >60/<40 for additional confirmation
- Most effective during US/London overlap hours

This strategy capitalizes on the market mechanics where liquidity grabs often lead to sustained moves, with the volatility expansion confirming the breakout's potential strength. The combination of on-chain and technical factors creates a robust filter against false breakouts.
