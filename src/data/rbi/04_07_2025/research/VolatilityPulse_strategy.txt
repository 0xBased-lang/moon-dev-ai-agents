STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility indicators with market sentiment to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during low-volatility conditions.

Key Components:
1. ATR (Average True Range) - Measures market volatility
2. ATR Moving Average (20-period) - Identifies volatility trends
3. VIX (Volatility Index) - Measures market fear/volatility expectations
4. 20-day VIX low - Identifies low-volatility market conditions
5. 2x ATR trailing stop - Dynamic exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Long entry triggered when:
   - 5-minute ATR crosses ABOVE its 20-period moving average (volatility expansion signal)
   - Current VIX is BELOW its 20-day low (confirming low-volatility regime)
2. All conditions must be met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing stop set at 2x the current ATR value
   - Stop moves up with favorable price movement
   - Locking in profits during strong trends
   - Provides room for normal volatility during trades

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on ATR:
   - Risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
   - Stop distance determines position size
2. No trades during high VIX periods (above 20-day average)
3. Time-based exit if no volatility expansion occurs

Required Indicators:
1. 5-minute ATR (14-period recommended)
2. 20-period moving average of ATR
3. Daily VIX with 20-day low calculation
4. Price chart with trailing stop functionality

Optimal Market Conditions:
- Works best in ranging or low-volatility markets
- Effective during early stages of volatility expansion
- Less effective during sustained high-volatility periods

Additional Notes:
- Consider combining with volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Backtest different ATR periods (14 vs 20) for optimization
- May benefit from filtering with trend confirmation on higher timeframe
