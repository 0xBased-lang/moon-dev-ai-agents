STRATEGY_NAME: VolcanicBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines explosive volume surges with Bollinger Band squeezes to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The name "VolcanicBreakout" reflects the explosive volume (volcanic) nature of the trades combined with the breakout mechanics.

Key Components:
1. Volume Surge Filter: Requires trading volume to exceed 3x the 20-day average volume
2. Bollinger Band Setup: Price must be in a squeeze (upper and lower bands close together)
3. Breakout Confirmation: Price must close outside the Bollinger Band
4. Protective Stop: Uses the breakout candle's low as stop-loss

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for volume to surge to at least 3x the 20-day average volume
2. Confirm price has been in a Bollinger Band squeeze (bands within 2% of each other)
3. Enter long when price closes above upper Bollinger Band on surge volume
4. Enter short when price closes below lower Bollinger Band on surge volume

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Trail stop at the most recent swing low
2. For short positions: Trail stop at the most recent swing high
3. Consider taking partial profits at 1.5x risk (measured from entry to stop)

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop-loss set at the breakout candle's low (long) or high (short)
2. Position size should be calculated based on 1-2% risk per trade
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (requires strategy review)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations recommended)
2. Volume indicator with 20-day average
3. Optional: ATR (14) for additional volatility measurement

Special Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets
- Avoid trading during major news events when volume spikes may be misleading
- Works well on 1-hour to daily timeframes
- Backtest suggests best results when combined with overall market trend direction
