STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationVolt  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Event Detection:** The strategy identifies rapid negative funding rate shifts, signaling potential market-wide liquidations.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Peaks:** Uses Bollinger Band width expansion to confirm volatility spikes during liquidation events.  
3. **Mean Reversion Exit:** Exits trades when price reverts to the mean (middle Bollinger Band) or volatility contracts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger: A sharp negative funding rate shift (e.g., >2 standard deviations from average).  
- Confirmation: Bollinger Band width (20-period, 2 StdDev) reaches a local peak (e.g., 90th percentile of recent width values).  
- Entry: Short volatility (e.g., via options, futures, or inverse volatility products) upon confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Primary Exit: Price touches the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).  
- Secondary Exit: Bollinger Band width contracts significantly (e.g., drops below 50th percentile of recent values).  
- Stop-Loss: If volatility continues expanding (width increases beyond entry peak + X%).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position Sizing: Allocate only 1-2% of capital per trade due to high volatility.  
- Stop-Loss: Hard stop at 5% loss or dynamic stop based on volatility expansion.  
- Avoid Overexposure: Limit concurrent trades to 3-5% of total portfolio.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Funding Rate** (from exchange data) to detect liquidation events.  
2. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 StdDev) for width and mean reversion signals.  
3. **Standard Deviation Filter** to quantify "rapid" funding rate shifts.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines on-chain data (funding rates) with technical indicators (Bollinger Bands).  
- Targets short volatility, a niche approach during liquidation cascades.  
- Uses bandwidth peaks instead of price breaks for higher precision.  

**Note:** Works best in crypto markets with perpetual futures. Backtest for optimal width percentile thresholds.
