STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicTrendSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicTrendSync strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum strength analysis to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to filter trades and manage risk.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification (EMA Crossover):
   - 50-period EMA (short-term trend)
   - 200-period EMA (long-term trend)
   - Bullish signal when 50EMA crosses above 200EMA

2. Trend Strength Confirmation (ADX):
   - ADX threshold set at 25
   - Rising ADX above 25 confirms strong trending conditions

3. Momentum Exhaustion Signals (RSI):
   - Overbought threshold at 70
   - Oversold threshold at 30
   - Used for exit signals only

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50EMA must cross above 200EMA (golden cross)
2. Confirmation: ADX must be rising and above 25 level
3. Entry Execution: Enter long position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking/Stop Loss: Exit position when RSI either:
   - Rises above 70 (overbought condition)
   - Falls below 30 (unexpected weakness)
2. Alternative Exit: Consider exiting if 50EMA crosses back below 200EMA (death cross)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: Initial stop can be placed below recent swing low
3. Trailing Stop: Consider moving stop to breakeven once trade moves favorably
4. Time Stop: Exit if trade doesn't develop within 5-10 periods

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Moving Averages:
   - 50-period EMA (fast)
   - 200-period EMA (slow)
2. Average Directional Index (ADX):
   - 14-period standard setting
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI):
   - 14-period standard setting

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ADX thresholds (20-30 range)
- Experiment with RSI periods (10-14)
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Backtest across different timeframes (best suited for daily/4hr charts)

This strategy works best in strongly trending markets and may produce false signals during ranging conditions. The ADX filter helps avoid weak trends while the RSI exit provides dynamic profit-taking levels.
