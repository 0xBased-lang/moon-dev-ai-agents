STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 20-day low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Surge Trigger:** Requires a 200% increase in volume compared to the 50-day average, confirming strong participation in the breakout.  
3. **Breakout Entry:** Enters a trade when price breaks out of the contracted Bollinger Bands, validated by the volume surge.  
4. **Opposing Band Exit:** Exits the trade when price reaches the opposite Bollinger Band, capturing the momentum move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Wait for Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) to reach a 20-day low, indicating contraction.  
- Confirm a 200% surge in volume relative to the 50-day average.  
- Enter long if price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or short if it breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- For long positions, exit when price touches the lower Bollinger Band.  
- For short positions, exit when price touches the upper Bollinger Band.  
- Alternatively, use a trailing stop or time-based exit (e.g., after 5-10 bars) if bands are too wide.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss at the midpoint of the Bollinger Bands or the recent swing low/high.  
- Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)  
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) calculation: (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band  
3. Volume (50-day average and current volume comparison)  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid sideways conditions.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., candle closes outside bands) for higher accuracy.  
- Adjust band settings (e.g., 50-period for slower markets) if needed.  

This strategy capitalizes on volatility contractions followed by high-volume breakouts, targeting mean-reversion at opposing bands.
