STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelFlowBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines price channel breakout dynamics with money flow confirmation for high-probability entries, using a disciplined risk-reward approach.

Key Components:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period) - Identifies breakout levels
2. Chaikin Money Flow - Confirms breakout strength with volume
3. Fixed 2:1 Risk-Reward Ratio - Ensures disciplined profit-taking

Entry Rules:
1. LONG Entry Trigger:
   - Price closes ABOVE the upper Donchian Channel (20-period high)
   - Chaikin Money Flow crosses ABOVE zero on same candle
   - Entry at next candle's open

2. SHORT Entry Trigger:
   - Price closes BELOW the lower Donchian Channel (20-period low)
   - Chaikin Money Flow crosses BELOW zero on same candle
   - Entry at next candle's open

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target:
   - Set at 2x the initial risk (distance from entry to opposite channel boundary)
   
2. Stop Loss:
   - Placed at opposite channel boundary from entry
   - For longs: below lower channel
   - For shorts: above upper channel

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. No pyramiding allowed (single position per signal)
3. Stop loss is mandatory on every trade
4. Trade only when both conditions align (price + CMF)

Required Indicators:
1. Donchian Channel (20 periods)
   - Upper Band: 20-period high
   - Lower Band: 20-period low
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20-period standard settings)
   - Must cross zero line in direction of trade

Optimization Notes:
1. Channel period can be tested between 15-30 periods
2. CMF period can be matched to channel period
3. Risk-reward can be adjusted between 1.5:1 to 3:1 based on volatility

This strategy works best in trending markets and requires confirmation from both price and volume indicators to filter false breakouts. The 2:1 reward ratio ensures profitability even with moderate win rates.
