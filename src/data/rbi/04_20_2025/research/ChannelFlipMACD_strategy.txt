STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelFlipMACD

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Donchian channel breakouts with MACD momentum confirmation and ATR-based risk management for a systematic trading approach.

Key Components:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period) - Identifies breakout levels
2. MACD Histogram - Confirms momentum shift
3. ATR (14-period) - Determines dynamic stop placement

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry Trigger:
   - Price closes above upper Donchian channel boundary (20-period high)
   - MACD histogram flips from negative to positive on same bar
   - Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop:
   - Initial stop placed at 2x ATR(14) below entry price
   - Stop trails upward at 2x ATR(14) below subsequent highs
   - No profit target - runs until stopped out

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade using stop distance
2. Stop level calculated as: Entry Price - (2 Ã— ATR(14))
3. No entries allowed if volatility (ATR) exceeds 3% of instrument price

Required Indicators:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period)
   - Upper band: 20-period high
   - Lower band: 20-period low
2. MACD (Standard 12,26,9 settings)
   - Focus on histogram crossing zero
3. ATR (14-period) for stop calculation

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- Requires confirmation candle close beyond channel
- Avoid trading during major news events due to false breakouts
- Performs well in trending markets, may underperform in ranges

Optimization Considerations:
1. Test different Donchian periods (15-30)
2. Experiment with ATR multiples (1.5-3x)
3. Consider adding volume filter for breakout confirmation
