STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Condition:** Identifies low volatility periods where the Bollinger Band width is less than 50% of its 20-day range, signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **VWAP Breakout Trigger:** Uses the 12-period Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as the breakout confirmation level.  
3. **Keltner Channel Exit:** Exits trades when price closes outside Keltner Channels with volume confirmation, ensuring momentum alignment.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a **long** position when:  
  - Bollinger Band width is below 50% of its 20-day range (squeeze condition).  
  - Price crosses **above** the 12-period VWAP.  
- Enter a **short** position when:  
  - Bollinger Band width is below 50% of its 20-day range (squeeze condition).  
  - Price crosses **below** the 12-period VWAP.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit **long** positions when:  
  - Price closes **below** the lower Keltner Channel with above-average volume.  
- Exit **short** positions when:  
  - Price closes **above** the upper Keltner Channel with above-average volume.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a **stop-loss** at the recent swing low (for longs) or swing high (for shorts) beyond the breakout candle.  
- Position sizing should account for volatility (e.g., ATR-based risk per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To measure squeeze conditions.  
2. **VWAP (12-period)** – For breakout confirmation.  
3. **Keltner Channels (20,1.5)** – For exit signals.  
4. **Volume** – To confirm exits.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **low-volatility detection (Bollinger Squeeze)** with **volume-weighted breakout triggers (VWAP)** for high-probability entries.  
- Uses **Keltner Channels + volume** for dynamic exits, reducing false breakouts.  
- Avoids generic trend-following by focusing on **compression-to-expansion** phases.  

**Note:** Works best on **15M-1H timeframes** for swing/day trading. Backtest optimal parameters for asset-specific volatility.
