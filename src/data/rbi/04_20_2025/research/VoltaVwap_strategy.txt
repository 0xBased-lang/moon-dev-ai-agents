STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaVwap  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Measurement:** Uses Average True Range (ATR) to gauge market volatility.  
2. **Price Anchor:** 20-period Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) serves as the baseline.  
3. **Breakout Bands:** 2x ATR bands plotted around VWAP to define breakout thresholds.  
4. **Momentum Filter:** Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms entries/exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when price closes **above** the upper band (VWAP + 2x ATR).  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when price closes **below** the lower band (VWAP - 2x ATR).  
- **RSI Confirmation:**  
  - For longs, RSI must be **above 40** (avoid weak momentum).  
  - For shorts, RSI must be **below 60** (avoid overbought reversals).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** RSI crosses **below 60** (captures profit before pullback).  
- **Short Exit:** RSI crosses **above 40** (covers before potential rebound).  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Longs: Lower band (VWAP - 2x ATR).  
  - Shorts: Upper band (VWAP + 2x ATR).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Adjust based on ATR (e.g., 1% risk per trade).  
2. **Dynamic Bands:** ATR adapts to changing volatility, tightening in calm markets and expanding in volatile ones.  
3. **RSI Filter:** Reduces false breakouts by requiring momentum alignment.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VWAP (20-period)** – Core baseline.  
2. **ATR (14-period recommended)** – Volatility bands.  
3. **RSI (14-period)** – Momentum filter.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volume-weighted price (VWAP) with volatility-adjusted breakouts, filtered by RSI to avoid whipsaws. Ideal for trending markets with clear volatility expansions.
