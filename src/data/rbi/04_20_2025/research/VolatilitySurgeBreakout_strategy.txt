STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility expansion signals with Bollinger Band breakouts to capture strong momentum moves, using a multi-timeframe ATR comparison for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Filter: Uses 5-minute vs daily ATR comparison (50% threshold)
2. Breakout Signal: Requires close above upper Bollinger Band
3. Profit Mechanism: Fixed 2:1 risk-reward ratio exits

Indicators Required:
- ATR (14-period) on both 5-minute and daily charts
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) on 5-minute chart

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for 5-minute ATR to exceed daily ATR by 50%
2. Confirm price closes above upper Bollinger Band on same 5-minute candle
3. Enter long at market on next candle open

Exit Rules:
1. Initial stop loss placed at lower Bollinger Band
2. Take profit set at 2x the distance between entry and stop
3. Optional: Trailing stop can be implemented after price moves 1.5x initial risk

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated based on stop distance
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. No new entries if daily ATR is below certain threshold (filter choppy markets)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending market conditions
- Requires monitoring of both timeframes simultaneously
- Most effective on liquid instruments with strong volatility characteristics

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust ATR percentage threshold (test 40-60% range)
- Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (18-22)
- Test different reward ratios (1.8:1 to 2.5:1)
