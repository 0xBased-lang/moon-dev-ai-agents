STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume analysis with Bollinger Band contraction and ADX trend confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities.

Key Components:
1. Volume Surge: Requires trading volume to exceed its 20-day moving average
2. Bollinger Band Contraction: Band width must be below its 10th percentile (extreme squeeze condition)
3. ADX Confirmation: Uses ADX cross above 25 as trend strength validation

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below its 10th percentile historical value
2. Monitor for volume spike exceeding 20-day average volume
3. Enter long on price breaking above upper Bollinger Band
4. Enter short on price breaking below lower Bollinger Band

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When ADX crosses above 25 (confirms strong trend)
2. Secondary Exit: When price closes back inside Bollinger Bands
3. Emergency Exit: If volume drops below 20-day average while in trade

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at opposite Bollinger Band
3. Trailing stop activated after ADX confirmation
4. Maximum trade duration of 5 days if no exit signals occur

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width (calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band)
3. 20-day Volume Moving Average
4. ADX (14-period) with +DI/-DI lines

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
- Works well in ranging markets preceding breakouts
- Requires historical percentile calculation for Bollinger Band width
- Volume spike should be at least 1.5x 20-day average for best results
- Avoid trading during major news events due to potential false breakouts
