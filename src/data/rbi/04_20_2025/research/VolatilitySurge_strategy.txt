STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines Bollinger Bandwidth contraction with a significant surge in volume to identify high-probability breakout/breakdown opportunities. The key components are:  

1. **Key Indicators**:  
   - **Bollinger Bands (20,2)**: Measures price volatility and identifies contraction periods.  
   - **Bollinger Bandwidth**: Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band (20-day SMA). Must be below its 20th percentile (indicating extreme contraction).  
   - **Volume ROC (Rate of Change)**: Must exceed 200% (a surge in trading activity confirming breakout potential).  

2. **Entry Rules**:  
   - **Long Entry**: When price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band AND Volume ROC > 200% AND Bandwidth is below its 20th percentile.  
   - **Short Entry**: When price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band AND Volume ROC > 200% AND Bandwidth is below its 20th percentile.  

3. **Exit Rules**:  
   - **Take-Profit**: Exit long positions when price touches the upper Bollinger Band again (or short positions when price touches the lower band).  
   - **Stop-Loss**: Set at the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., for long positions, stop-loss at the lower band).  

4. **Risk Management**:  
   - Position sizing should account for volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing).  
   - Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to ensure volume signals are reliable.  
   - Only trade when both conditions (Bandwidth contraction + Volume ROC surge) align.  

5. **Additional Notes**:  
   - Works best in trending markets after consolidation.  
   - False breakouts may occurâ€”wait for closing price confirmation beyond bands.  
   - Backtest to optimize percentile threshold (20% may vary by asset).  

This strategy capitalizes on "squeeze" setups with volume confirmation, making it distinct from standard Bollinger Band strategies.
