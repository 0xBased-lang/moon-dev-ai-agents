STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Keltner Channel (20-period):** A volatility-based envelope indicator that helps identify breakout opportunities. The channel consists of an exponential moving average (EMA) centerline and upper/lower bands based on Average True Range (ATR).  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires trading volume to exceed the 50-day average volume to validate the breakout signal.  
3. **ATR Trailing Stop:** Uses a trailing stop set to 2x the 14-period ATR to protect profits and limit losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when price closes above the upper Keltner Channel band AND volume exceeds the 50-day average.  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when price closes below the lower Keltner Channel band AND volume exceeds the 50-day average.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Close Inside Channel:** Exit the trade if price closes back inside the Keltner Channel (above the lower band for shorts, below the upper band for longs).  
2. **Trailing Stop:** Exit when price hits the trailing stop level, which is set at 2x the 14-period ATR from the most recent extreme (high for longs, low for shorts).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop distance to ensure risk per trade aligns with overall capital preservation goals.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic events that may distort volatility.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channel (20-period, 2x ATR width)**  
2. **50-day Average Volume**  
3. **14-period Average True Range (ATR)**  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility breakout (Keltner Channel) with volume confirmation for higher-probability signals.  
- Uses a dynamic trailing stop based on ATR to adapt to changing market conditions.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring volume expansion.  

This strategy is best suited for trending markets and may underperform in choppy or range-bound conditions.
