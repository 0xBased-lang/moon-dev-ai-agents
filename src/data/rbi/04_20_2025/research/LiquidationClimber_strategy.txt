STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationClimber

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on market inefficiencies created by forced liquidations during low volatility periods, combining on-chain liquidation data with technical volatility indicators for precise entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. On-chain liquidation cluster detection
2. Volatility regime analysis (low volatility conditions)
3. Statistical anomaly identification (2σ liquidation spikes)
4. ATR-based volatility expansion signals

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Market must be in low volatility regime (ATR below 30-day average)
2. Trigger: Liquidation spike exceeding 2 standard deviations above mean liquidation volume
3. Confirmation: Price must show initial counter-move against liquidation direction
4. Execution: Enter position opposite to liquidation direction (e.g., long if shorts liquidated)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: ATR crosses above its 30-day average (volatility expansion signal)
2. Secondary Exit: 2:1 reward/risk ratio achieved
3. Emergency Exit: Liquidation volume drops below 1 standard deviation from mean

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop placement: 1 ATR value from entry point
3. Maximum drawdown limit: 15% account equity
4. Trade frequency limit: 3 positions open simultaneously

Required Indicators:
1. On-chain liquidation data feed (preferably with historical standard deviation calculations)
2. 14-period ATR (for volatility measurement)
3. 30-day simple moving average of ATR (for regime definition)
4. Standard deviation calculator for liquidation volumes (30-day lookback)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in sideways/consolidating markets
- Requires real-time liquidation data feed
- Most effective on liquid assets with high leverage markets
- Performance improves with additional confirmation from order book depth analysis

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust standard deviation multiplier (1.5σ-2.5σ) based on asset volatility
- Consider adding time filter (e.g., only trade during high liquidity hours)
- May combine with RSI extremes for additional confirmation
