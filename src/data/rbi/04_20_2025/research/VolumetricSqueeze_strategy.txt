STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility where the Bollinger Bands contract significantly, indicating a potential breakout.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** A surge in volume percentile (e.g., above 70-80th percentile) is required to confirm the breakout direction, ensuring the move is supported by strong participation.  
3. **Breakout Direction:** The trade is taken in the direction of the breakout (long if price breaks above the upper band, short if below the lower band).  
4. **Exit Condition:** The trade is closed when price closes beyond 2x the contracted bandwidth of the Bollinger Bands at the time of the squeeze.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for a Bollinger Band squeeze (contraction where the bands are notably tighter than recent averages).  
2. Confirm the breakout with a surge in volume (e.g., volume percentile > 70-80).  
3. Enter long if price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with high volume.  
4. Enter short if price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with high volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. Calculate the contracted bandwidth of the Bollinger Bands at the time of the squeeze (distance between upper and lower bands).  
2. Exit the trade when price closes beyond 2x this bandwidth in the direction of the trade.  
   - For long trades: Exit if price closes below (entry price - 2x bandwidth).  
   - For short trades: Exit if price closes above (entry price + 2x bandwidth).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing should be based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
2. A stop-loss can be placed at 1x the bandwidth to limit downside if the breakout fails.  
3. Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (standard settings: 20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. Volume Percentile (e.g., 50- or 100-period lookback to determine percentile).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Backtest to optimize volume percentile thresholds and bandwidth multipliers for specific instruments.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend analysis to filter trades in the dominant trend direction.
