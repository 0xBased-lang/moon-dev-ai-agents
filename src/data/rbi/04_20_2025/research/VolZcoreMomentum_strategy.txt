STRATEGY_NAME: VolZcoreMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility scaling with momentum trading through a sophisticated Z-score analysis of volume-adjusted price returns. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Key Components:
1. Volatility Scaling: Uses rolling standard deviation to normalize momentum signals
2. Volume-Adjusted Returns: Incorporates trading volume as a weighting factor in return calculations
3. Z-score Transformation: Converts raw momentum into standardized units for comparison
4. Historical Quartile Analysis: Uses percentile thresholds based on historical distribution

Entry Rules:
1. Calculate daily volume-adjusted returns: (Price Return * Volume)/Average Volume
2. Compute rolling Z-scores (20-day lookback) of these adjusted returns
3. Enter long when:
   - Current Z-score > 75th percentile of historical distribution
   - Volume is above 20-day average
4. Enter short when:
   - Current Z-score < 25th percentile of historical distribution
   - Volume is above 20-day average

Exit Rules:
1. Long positions exit when Z-score crosses below 50th percentile
2. Short positions exit when Z-score crosses above 50th percentile
3. Emergency exit if Z-score reaches opposite extreme (90th/10th percentile)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (1% risk per trade)
2. Stop-loss at 2x the 20-day average true range
3. Maximum portfolio allocation of 5% per position
4. Daily rebalancing to maintain risk parity

Required Indicators:
1. Rolling Z-score calculator (20-day window)
2. Volume-weighted price returns
3. Historical percentile calculator (100-day lookback)
4. Average True Range (ATR) for stop-loss
5. Volume moving average (20-day)

Optimization Notes:
- Backtest different lookback periods for Z-score calculation
- Experiment with percentile thresholds (70/30 vs 75/25)
- Test various volatility scaling methods
- Consider adding a confirmation filter (e.g., RSI divergence)

This strategy excels in trending markets with expanding volume, while the Z-score normalization helps avoid false signals during low-volatility periods. The volume adjustment provides an additional layer of confirmation for significant moves.
