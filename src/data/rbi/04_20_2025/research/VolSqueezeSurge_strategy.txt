STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Squeeze Detection**: Uses Bollinger Bands (BB) contraction below a historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile of BB width over 100 periods) to identify low-volatility conditions.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation**: Requires BB expansion (price closing outside the bands) accompanied by a surge in volume exceeding its 20-day moving average.  
3. **Directional Bias**: Long entries on upper BB breakout, short entries on lower BB breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. BB width (upper - lower band) is below its 20th percentile (indicating squeeze).  
  2. Price closes above the upper BB.  
  3. Volume exceeds its 20-day average by at least 1.5x.  
- **Short Entry**:  
  1. BB width is below its 20th percentile.  
  2. Price closes below the lower BB.  
  3. Volume exceeds its 20-day average by at least 1.5x.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking**:  
  - Trailing stop: Exit when price retraces 50% of the breakout candle’s range.  
  - Or, fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
- **Stop-Loss**:  
  - Place stop below the breakout candle’s low (for longs) or above its high (for shorts).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk ≤ 1% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. BB width percentile (100-period lookback).  
3. Volume 20-day moving average.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with volume-confirmed expansion.  
- Filters false breakouts using volume surge, reducing whipsaw trades.  
- Adaptive to low-volatility regimes, capitalizing on impending volatility spikes.
