STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy specializes in identifying and capitalizing on volatility compression breakouts using a multi-indicator approach combining Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels with volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Percentile: Measures the relative tightness of Bollinger Bands compared to historical levels
2. Keltner Channel Squeeze: Identifies periods of extreme volatility contraction
3. Volume Confirmation: Requires breakout volume above 20-day average for validity
4. Breakout Expansion: Looks for confirmed expansion after compression periods

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to fall below 20th percentile (indicating compression)
2. Confirm Keltner Channel is in squeeze state (upper and lower bands within Bollinger Bands)
3. Enter long when:
   - Price breaks above upper Keltner Channel
   - Volume exceeds 20-day average volume
   - Bollinger Band width expands from compressed state
4. Enter short when:
   - Price breaks below lower Keltner Channel
   - Volume exceeds 20-day average volume
   - Bollinger Band width expands from compressed state

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit:
   - 2x ATR (Average True Range) from entry point
   - OR when Bollinger Band width reaches 80th percentile
2. Stop Loss:
   - 1x ATR from entry point
   - OR when price re-enters Keltner Channel

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Requires minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Keltner Channels (20,2 ATR multiplier)
3. Volume (20-day average)
4. ATR (14-period for stop/target calculations)
5. Bollinger Band Width Percentile (100-period lookback)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
2. Works well with liquid instruments (forex majors, large-cap stocks)
3. Requires at least 3 months of historical data for percentile calculations
4. Most effective in ranging markets transitioning to trends
