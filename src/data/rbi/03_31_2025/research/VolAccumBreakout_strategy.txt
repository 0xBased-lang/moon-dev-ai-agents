STRATEGY_NAME: VolAccum Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band compression, money flow analysis, and volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during periods of accumulation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band (20,2) - Identifies compression periods when price hugs the lower band
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20) - Detects accumulation when crossing above zero
3. Volume - Confirms breakout validity with increased participation

Entry Rules:
1. Price must be consolidating within the lower Bollinger Band (touching or near lower band)
2. Chaikin Money Flow must cross above zero line
3. Breakout occurs when price closes above the consolidation high
4. Volume on breakout should be above recent average

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit at 1.5x the height of the consolidation pattern
2. Stop loss placed below the recent swing low within consolidation
3. Alternative exit when Chaikin Money Flow crosses below zero

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Risk-reward ratio minimum 1:1.5
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may distort volatility

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 std dev)
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20 periods)
3. Volume indicator (simple moving average of volume)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets (confirm with higher timeframe trend)
- Most effective on daily/4h timeframes
- Avoid using during extremely low volatility conditions
- Combine with higher timeframe support/resistance for better accuracy

This "VolAccum Breakout" strategy specifically targets the sweet spot where accumulation meets volatility contraction, providing high-quality breakout signals with confirmed money flow and volume participation.
