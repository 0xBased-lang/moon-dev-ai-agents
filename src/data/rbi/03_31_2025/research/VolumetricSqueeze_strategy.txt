STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume divergence analysis with Bollinger Band compression to identify high-probability breakout opportunities with controlled risk. The unique combination of volume dynamics and volatility contraction creates a powerful confluence for entries.

Key Components:
1. Volume Divergence EMA (3-day exponential moving average of volume divergence)
2. Volatility-scaled threshold (dynamic level adjusted to market conditions)
3. Bollinger Band Width (measures band contraction/expansion)
4. Risk-adjusted stop (position sizing based on volatility)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 3-day EMA of volume divergence must cross ABOVE the volatility-scaled threshold
2. Confirmation: Bollinger Band width must be in contraction phase (narrowing bands)
3. Entry Trigger: Both conditions must be met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When volume divergence EMA crosses BELOW the volatility-scaled threshold
2. Protective Stop: Fixed percentage stop based on ATR (Average True Range) or volatility measure
3. Optional Profit Target: 2:1 risk-reward ratio or trailing stop based on band expansion

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk (typically 1-2% per trade)
2. Stop placement at recent swing low (for longs) or volatility-based distance
3. Volatility scaling adjusts position size for current market conditions

Required Indicators:
1. Volume Divergence Indicator (custom calculation)
2. 3-day Exponential Moving Average (applied to volume divergence)
3. Bollinger Bands (standard 20-period, 2 std dev)
4. Volatility measure (ATR or standard deviation)
5. Threshold scaling mechanism (dynamic level calculation)

Unique Aspects:
- Combines volume dynamics with price compression
- Uses volatility-adjusted thresholds for adaptive entries
- Requires confluence of two independent technical factors
- Incorporates both momentum and mean-reversion principles

Optimization Notes:
- Threshold scaling factor may need calibration for different instruments
- EMA period can be adjusted for more/less sensitivity
- Band width contraction threshold should be tested for optimal settings
- Timeframe agnostic but works best on daily or 4H charts
