STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses Keltner Channel squeeze to identify periods of low volatility, indicating potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** Requires a 150% increase in volume compared to the 10-day average to validate the breakout.  
3. **ATR-Based Exit:** Exits the trade when price moves 2x the initial Average True Range (ATR) from the entry point, ensuring a systematic profit-taking approach.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Keltner Channel Squeeze:** Wait for the Keltner Channel (typically set with a 20-period EMA and 2x ATR width) to contract, signaling low volatility.  
2. **Volume Surge:** Confirm the breakout with a volume spike of at least 150% of the 10-day average volume.  
3. **Directional Breakout:** Enter long if price breaks above the upper Keltner Channel or short if it breaks below the lower channel.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Close the trade when price reaches 2x the initial ATR value from the entry point.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Set a stop loss at 1x the initial ATR value to manage risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Adjust position size based on the ATR to ensure consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1% of capital risked per trade).  
2. **Stop Loss:** Always use the 1x ATR stop loss to limit downside.  
3. **Avoid Overlapping Trades:** Do not enter new trades until the current one is closed to prevent overexposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channel** (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width).  
2. **Volume Indicator** (10-day average volume for comparison).  
3. **Average True Range (ATR)** (14-period ATR for volatility measurement).  

This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume confirmation, and ATR-based exits to capitalize on high-probability breakout opportunities while managing risk effectively.
