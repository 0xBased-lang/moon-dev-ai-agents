STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Strategy Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Analysis: Identifies high-density liquidation levels from order book data where large clusters of stop-loss orders are concentrated
2. Contrarian Approach: Takes positions opposite to the prevailing trend when price breaches these key liquidation levels
3. Confirmation Signals: Uses RSI divergence and volume spikes to validate reversal opportunities
4. Mean-Reversion Focus: Capitalizes on overextended moves that trigger cascading liquidations

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Price must breach a pre-identified liquidation cluster level (derived from order book analysis)
2. RSI Confirmation: Must show bullish divergence (for long entries) or bearish divergence (for short entries) on the 4H or 1D timeframe
3. Volume Spike: Requires at least 2x average volume on the breach candle
4. Entry Execution: Enter on first pullback after breach confirmation, with limit orders placed at 38.2% retracement of the liquidation move

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - First target: 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry
   - Second target: Previous swing high/low (for mean reversion to fair value)
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Placed at 1x ATR beyond the liquidation cluster level
   - Trailed using parabolic SAR once price reaches first target

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1% of capital per trade
2. Maximum Drawdown: Cease trading for the day after 3 consecutive losses
3. Time Filter: Avoid trading during low liquidity periods (overnight sessions, holidays)
4. Asset Selection: Only trade instruments with verifiable order book depth data

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation Heatmap (custom order book visualization)
2. 14-period RSI (for divergence detection)
3. 20-period ATR (for risk measurement)
4. Volume Profile (for spike confirmation)
5. Parabolic SAR (for trailing stops)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in high-leverage crypto markets where liquidations are frequent
- Requires real-time order book data feed
- Most effective after prolonged trends when positioning becomes extreme
- Combines both technical (RSI/volume) and on-chain (liquidation data) analysis
