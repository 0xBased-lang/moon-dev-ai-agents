STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeCascade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines funding rate analysis with Bollinger Band compression to identify high-probability short opportunities in perpetual swap markets, specifically targeting liquidation cascades during volatility expansions.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Filter: Only considers trades when funding rates are significantly positive (0.01% or higher), indicating excessive long positioning
2. Bollinger Band Setup: Uses standard 20-period BB with 2 standard deviations
3. Volatility Trigger: Requires price to break below the lower Bollinger Band after a period of contraction (bandwidth < X% of 20-period average)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Entry: Short when:
   - Funding rate > 0.01% (adjustable threshold)
   - Bollinger Bandwidth < 50% of its 20-period average (squeeze condition)
   - Price breaks below lower band with increasing volume
2. Secondary Entry: Add to position if:
   - Price retests broken lower band from below
   - Funding rate remains elevated
   - Open interest continues increasing

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - First target: 1.5x average true range (ATR) below entry
   - Second target: Previous swing low or liquidity zone
2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop: Upper Bollinger Band
   - Trailing stop: 50% of position at break-even when price reaches 1x ATR profit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum Drawdown: 5% account limit
3. Trade Frequency: Only 1-2 concurrent positions
4. Blackout Period: Avoid trading during major macroeconomic events

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Funding Rate monitor
3. Volume indicator
4. Average True Range (14)
5. Bandwidth calculation (BB width / middle band)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets with periodic volatility contractions
- Most effective on mid-to-high cap perpetuals with deep liquidity
- Requires monitoring of open interest and liquidation heatmaps
- Performance improves when combined with exchange-specific liquidation level data

The "SqueezeCascade" strategy exploits the combination of overleveraged long positions (via funding rates) and technical compression patterns to target asymmetric risk/reward opportunities during market breakdowns.
