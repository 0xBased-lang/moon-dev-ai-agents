STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicPulse strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that combines short-term ATR signals with VIX market sentiment to identify high-probability long entries in low-volatility environments. The strategy capitalizes on emerging volatility while maintaining tight risk control through an adaptive trailing stop mechanism.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses 5-minute ATR (14-period) to gauge short-term price volatility
2. Trend Filter: 20-period moving average of ATR identifies increasing volatility trends
3. Market Sentiment: VIX position relative to 10-day low confirms low-volatility environment
4. Dynamic Exit: 2x ATR trailing stop locks in profits while allowing room for volatility expansion

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 5-minute ATR (14) crosses ABOVE its 20-period moving average
2. Confirmation: Current VIX value must be BELOW its 10-day low
3. Execution: Enter long position at market when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: Maintain a stop loss at 2x the current ATR value below the highest high since entry
2. Stop Adjustment: Update the trailing stop continuously as price moves higher
3. No time-based exit - position remains open until stopped out

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade based on entry price to stop distance
2. Volatility Filter: Only trade when VIX confirms low-volatility environment (below 10-day low)
3. Stop Discipline: Never widen the 2x ATR trailing stop once set

Required Indicators:
1. ATR (14-period) on 5-minute chart
2. 20-period SMA of ATR (for crossover signal)
3. VIX index with 10-day low reference
4. Trailing stop calculation (2x current ATR)

Optimal Market Conditions:
- Works best in transitioning markets from low to moderate volatility
- Effective during early stages of trend development
- Avoid high VIX environments (above 10-day average)
- Particularly suited for liquid instruments with consistent volatility patterns

Note: This strategy requires continuous monitoring of the 5-minute timeframe and regular VIX updates. The 2x ATR stop provides balance between giving trades room to breathe while protecting against excessive drawdowns during volatility spikes.
