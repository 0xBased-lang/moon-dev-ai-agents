STRATEGY_NAME: VortexMomentum  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Measures trend direction and strength using two lines (VI+ and VI-). VI+ crossing above VI- signals bullish trend, while VI- crossing above VI+ signals bearish trend.  
2. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** Identifies overbought/oversold conditions (typically above +50 or below -50).  
3. **Volume Surge:** Confirms entries when volume exceeds the 20-day moving average.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  - CMO is below -50 (oversold condition).  
  - Current volume > 20-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  - CMO is above +50 (overbought condition).  
  - Current volume > 20-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** VI- crosses above VI+ (trend reversal to bearish).  
- **Short Exit:** VI+ crosses above VI- (trend reversal to bullish).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss at recent swing low (for longs) or swing high (for shorts).  
- Use a trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR) to lock in profits.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO, 14-period default).  
3. 20-day moving average of volume.  
4. Optional: ATR for dynamic stop placement.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid ranging conditions.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., support/resistance) for higher accuracy.  
- Backtest optimal CMO thresholds for your asset (e.g., ±40 or ±60).
