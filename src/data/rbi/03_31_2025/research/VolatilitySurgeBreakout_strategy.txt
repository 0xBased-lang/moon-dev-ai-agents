STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility expansion with volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities, using VWAP deviation bands as dynamic support/resistance levels.

Key Components:
1. VWAP Standard Deviation Bands (14-period)
2. Volume Median (30-day lookback)
3. Price action relative to VWAP bands

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price closes ABOVE upper 2x VWAP standard deviation band
   - Current volume exceeds 30-day median volume
   - Enter on next candle's open

2. Short Entry:
   - Price closes BELOW lower 2x VWAP standard deviation band
   - Current volume exceeds 30-day median volume
   - Enter on next candle's open

Exit Rules:
1. Long Exit:
   - Price crosses back below the 1x VWAP standard deviation band
   - OR price touches the 0.5x VWAP standard deviation band

2. Short Exit:
   - Price crosses back above the 1x VWAP standard deviation band
   - OR price touches the 0.5x VWAP standard deviation band

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at opposite 2x VWAP band
3. Trailing stop can be implemented using the 1.5x VWAP band
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% recommended

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) with standard deviation bands
   - Primary period: 14
   - Band multiples: 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x
2. Volume indicator with 30-day median calculation

Optimal Market Conditions:
- Works best in trending markets after periods of consolidation
- Most effective in liquid instruments with consistent volume patterns
- Avoid ranging markets with frequent mean reversion

Additional Notes:
- The 2x deviation acts as a volatility filter to avoid false breakouts
- Volume surge confirms institutional participation in the move
- VWAP reversion provides natural profit-taking levels
- Consider combining with trend confirmation for higher timeframes
