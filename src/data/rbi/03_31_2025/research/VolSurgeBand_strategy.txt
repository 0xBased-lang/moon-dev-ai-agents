STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeBand  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) percentile rank below 10% to identify extreme compression, signaling potential breakout setups.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires relative volume surges (>200% of 20-day average) to validate breakout potential and filter false signals.  
3. **Bollinger Band Touch Exit:** Exits trades when price touches the opposing Bollinger Band (upper band for long exits, lower band for short exits).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - BBW percentile rank <10% (volatility contraction)  
  - Current volume > 200% of 20-day average volume  
  - Price closes above the middle Bollinger Band (20MA)  
- **Short Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - BBW percentile rank <10%  
  - Current volume > 200% of 20-day average volume  
  - Price closes below the middle Bollinger Band  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target/Stop:** Close position when price touches the opposing Bollinger Band:  
  - Long exit: Upper band touch  
  - Short exit: Lower band touch  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** Middle band (20MA) as trailing stop for aggressive risk management.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade.  
2. Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false volume spikes.  
3. Filter entries to liquid assets to ensure smooth band interactions.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period MA, 2 standard deviations)  
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band  
3. BBW Percentile Rank (10% threshold)  
4. 20-day rolling average volume + current volume comparison.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression (low BBW) with explosive volume surges, targeting mean-reversion breakouts with clear exit logic. Works best on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trades.
