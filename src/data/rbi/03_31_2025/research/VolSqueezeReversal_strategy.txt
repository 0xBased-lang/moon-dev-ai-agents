STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Signal:** Uses Heikin-Ashi candles on the 4-hour timeframe to identify periods of tightening price action (smaller candle bodies).  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Threshold:** Monitors when the Heikin-Ashi candle body contracts below a predefined threshold (e.g., 20% of the candle range) while Bollinger Bands narrow significantly (indicating low volatility).  
3. **Funding Rate Flip:** Confirms a potential reversal when perpetual swap funding rates turn negative, suggesting excessive short positioning.  
4. **Liquidation Cluster Anchoring:** Places stop-loss orders near recent liquidation clusters (high-density order zones) to avoid being caught in false breakouts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **long volatility** (e.g., buy options, enter futures, or trade spot with tight stops) when:  
  1. The 4-hour Heikin-Ashi candle body contracts below the squeeze threshold (e.g., body < 20% of total range).  
  2. Bollinger Band width (upper - lower band) is at a 20-period low.  
  3. Funding rates flip negative (confirming bearish overcrowding).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take profit when:  
  1. Bollinger Bands expand significantly (volatility breakout).  
  2. Heikin-Ashi candles show strong directional momentum (large body in the opposite direction).  
  3. Funding rates revert to positive (indicating short squeeze exhaustion).  
- Stop-loss placed just below the nearest liquidation cluster (identified via order book heatmaps or historical liquidations data).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on the distance to the liquidation cluster stop (e.g., risk 1-2% per trade).  
- Avoid entering if Bollinger Bands are still widening (no squeeze present).  
- Filter out low-liquidity assets to prevent slippage.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (4-hour timeframe).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 StdDev).  
3. Funding rate monitor (exchange-specific perpetual swap data).  
4. Liquidation cluster heatmap (tools like Hyblock, Coinglass, or order book analysis).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction, sentiment extremes (funding rates), and liquidation-based stops to exploit mean-reversion in high-leverage markets. The name "VolSqueezeReversal" reflects its focus on volatility compression and contrarian positioning.
