STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction**: The strategy identifies periods of extreme low volatility when the Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 6-month low, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation**: A 50% increase in trading volume compared to the 30-day average confirms the breakout signal, adding validity to the setup.  
3. **Breakout Direction Entry**: The actual trade is triggered in the direction of the breakout from the contracted Bollinger Bands.  
4. **ATR-Based Exit**: Positions are closed when the price moves 2x the Average True Range (ATR) away from the breakout candle's closing price, ensuring a systematic exit.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for the Bollinger Bandwidth to contract to its lowest level in the past 6 months.  
2. Confirm the setup with a surge in volumeâ€”at least 50% higher than the 30-day average volume.  
3. Enter long if the price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or short if it breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
4. The entry is executed on the close of the breakout candle.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. Set a profit target at 2x the ATR (calculated over a 14-period lookback) from the breakout candle's closing price.  
2. Alternatively, exit if the Bollinger Bandwidth expands significantly, indicating the end of the breakout momentum.  
3. Use a trailing stop based on ATR to protect profits if the price moves favorably.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing should be based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
2. A stop-loss can be placed at 1x ATR from the entry point to limit downside risk.  
3. Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations) to measure bandwidth contraction.  
2. **Volume Indicator** (30-day average volume) to confirm the surge.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR)** (14-period) for setting profit targets and stop-loss levels.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets after periods of consolidation.  
- Backtest across multiple asset classes to ensure robustness.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend analysis to filter high-probability trades.
