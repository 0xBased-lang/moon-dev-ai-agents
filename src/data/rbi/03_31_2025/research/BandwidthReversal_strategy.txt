STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band Width reaches a 20-day low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **MACD Histogram Confirmation:** Requires the MACD histogram to turn positive, indicating upward momentum before entering a trade.  
3. **ATR-Based Profit Target:** Uses a dynamic exit at 2x the 10-day Average True Range (ATR) to capture volatility-adjusted gains.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - Bollinger Band Width (BBW) hits a 20-day low (indicating extreme contraction).  
  - MACD histogram crosses above zero (confirming bullish momentum).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit the trade when price reaches **2x the 10-day ATR** from the entry point.  
- **Stop Loss:** No explicit stop is mentioned, but a trailing or fixed stop (e.g., 1x ATR) could be added for risk control.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Adjust trade size based on ATR to normalize risk per trade.  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if ATR is excessively high (e.g., above a historical percentile).  
- **Optional Stop:** Implement a stop-loss at 1x ATR below entry if needed.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 Std Dev) → To calculate Band Width (BBW).  
2. **MACD** (12, 26, 9) → For histogram crossover confirmation.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR)** (10-period) → For dynamic profit target.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (BBW) with momentum shift (MACD) for high-probability reversals.  
- Uses ATR for adaptive profit-taking, scaling exits with market conditions.  
- Avoids generic trend-following by focusing on low-volatility setups.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different BBW lookback periods (e.g., 10-30 days).  
- Experiment with MACD settings or add RSI filter (e.g., >30 for longs).  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5x-3x) based on asset volatility.
