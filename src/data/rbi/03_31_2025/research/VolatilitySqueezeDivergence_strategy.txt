STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Bands width contracts below historical percentiles (e.g., below the 20th percentile), signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **Cumulative Delta Divergence:** A positive divergence in cumulative delta (buying pressure) confirms strength behind the breakout, increasing the likelihood of a sustained move.  
3. **Liquidity Void Anchored Stops:** Stops are placed beyond recent liquidity voids (areas of minimal order book depth), reducing the risk of premature exits due to minor retracements.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger a long position when:  
  1. Bollinger Bands width is below its historical low percentile (e.g., 20th percentile).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Cumulative delta shows a positive divergence (higher lows in delta while price makes lower lows or consolidates).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Use a trailing stop or predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) based on the initial stop distance.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place the stop below the nearest liquidity void (recent swing low or order book thin zone).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size is determined by the distance to the stop level, ensuring risk per trade is capped (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to reduce slippage.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2)** – To measure volatility contraction.  
2. **Bollinger Bands Width** – Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band, filtered by historical percentile.  
3. **Cumulative Delta** – Tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure.  
4. **Order Book Analysis (optional)** – To identify liquidity voids for stop placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction with order flow confirmation (cumulative delta).  
- Uses liquidity-based stops for improved risk management.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring divergence in buying pressure.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize percentile thresholds for Bollinger Bands width and delta divergence sensitivity.
