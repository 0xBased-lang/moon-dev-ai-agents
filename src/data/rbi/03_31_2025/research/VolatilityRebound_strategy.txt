STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityRebound  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Negative Funding Rates:** Indicates potential market overselling or excessive short positioning, creating conditions for a possible reversal.  
2. **Volume Spike (90th Percentile):** Confirms strong market participation, suggesting a high-probability entry point.  
3. **Lower Bollinger Band Touch:** Identifies a potential oversold condition, aligning with mean-reversion principles.  
4. **Volatility Contraction Exit:** Uses reduced volatility as a signal to lock in profits or avoid prolonged consolidation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when all three conditions are met:  
  1. Funding rate is negative (indicating bearish sentiment).  
  2. Trading volume exceeds the 90th percentile of recent historical volume (e.g., last 30 days).  
  3. Price touches or crosses the lower Bollinger Band (20-period SMA, 2 Std Dev).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Condition:** Close the position when volatility (measured by Bollinger Band width or ATR) contracts below a rolling 12-hour average threshold.  
- Alternative Exit: Consider a trailing stop or fixed take-profit (e.g., 2-3x risk) if volatility remains elevated.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the high volatility of the setup (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Stop-loss placed below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 1.5x the Bollinger Band width).  
- Avoid trading during major news events or illiquid periods to prevent false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 Std Dev).  
2. **Volume Percentile** (90th percentile threshold based on 30-day lookback).  
3. **Funding Rate** (real-time data from exchange API).  
4. **Volatility Measure** (e.g., Bollinger Band width or 14-period ATR for exit logic).  

**Notes:**  
- Backtest across multiple assets to confirm robustness.  
- Works best in crypto markets due to funding rate dynamics.  
- Combine with additional filters (e.g., RSI divergence) to reduce false signals.
