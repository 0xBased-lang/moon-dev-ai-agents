STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines MACD histogram divergence analysis with volume confirmation to identify high-probability reversal points, using Fibonacci retracement levels derived from recent volatility for precise exit targeting.

Key Components:
1. MACD Histogram Divergence: 
   - Bullish divergence when price makes lower lows while MACD makes higher lows
   - Bearish divergence when price makes higher highs while MACD makes lower highs
   - Divergence must exceed historical threshold (e.g., 2 standard deviations from mean)

2. Volume Surge Confirmation:
   - Volume must spike above 20-period moving average by at least 50%
   - Volume should confirm divergence direction (higher volume on bullish divergence bars)

3. Fibonacci Exit Levels:
   - Calculate recent volatility swing (high-to-low for bearish, low-to-high for bullish)
   - Key levels: 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% retracement of the swing
   - Primary target at 38.2%, secondary at 50%, final at 61.8%

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Bullish MACD histogram divergence exceeding threshold
   - Volume surge confirming bullish momentum
   - Entry on close of divergence-confirming candle

2. Short Entry:
   - Bearish MACD histogram divergence exceeding threshold
   - Volume surge confirming bearish momentum
   - Entry on close of divergence-confirming candle

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - Scale out at Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)
   - Consider closing full position at 61.8% if strong resistance/support

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place below recent swing low (long) or above swing high (short)
   - Alternative: 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit: 5% of account
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Filter trades with volatility contraction (ATR below 20-period MA)

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12,26,9) - histogram mode
2. Volume indicator with 20-period MA
3. Average True Range (ATR) 14-period
4. Fibonacci retracement tool
5. Standard deviation calculator for divergence thresholds

Optimization Notes:
- Backtest divergence thresholds for specific instruments
- Adjust volume surge percentage based on asset liquidity
- Test different Fibonacci levels for optimal exits
- Consider adding Bollinger Bands as additional confirmation
