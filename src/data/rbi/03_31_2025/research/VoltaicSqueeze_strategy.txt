STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Bands width reaches a 20-day low, signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** A breakout is confirmed only when volume exceeds the 50-day average, ensuring the move has strong participation.  
3. **Breakout Direction:** The strategy enters long if the price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band and short if it breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands width is at a 20-day low (indicating a squeeze).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds the 50-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands width is at a 20-day low.  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds the 50-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  1. Price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands.  
  2. Or, a trailing stop-loss is triggered (e.g., 2x ATR).  
- **Short Exit:**  
  1. Price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands.  
  2. Or, a trailing stop-loss is triggered (e.g., 2x ATR).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop-loss placed at 1.5x ATR (Average True Range) from the entry price.  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Trailing Stop:** Adjust stop-loss to lock in profits as the trade moves favorably (e.g., 2x ATR trailing).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** To identify the squeeze and breakout levels.  
2. **Volume (50-day MA):** To confirm breakout validity.  
3. **ATR (14):** For stop-loss and trailing stop calculations.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (Bollinger Squeeze) with volume confirmation for higher-probability breakouts.  
- Uses ATR for dynamic risk management, adapting to market conditions.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring volume spikes.  

This strategy is ideal for trending markets and works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1H or daily charts).
