STRATEGY_NAME: KeltnerContrarian  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Keltner Channel Breakout:** Uses a 4-hour close above the upper Keltner Channel as a volatility-based entry signal.  
2. **Contrarian Funding Signal:** Requires negative funding rates (-0.1% annualized) on perpetual swaps to confirm a potential reversal or short squeeze scenario.  
3. **Fixed Risk-Reward:** Targets a 1:1 risk-reward ratio, suggesting tight stop-loss placement relative to the entry.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - The 4-hour candle closes above the upper Keltner Channel.  
  - Funding rates on perpetual swaps are at or below -0.1% (annualized), indicating excessive short positioning.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take-Profit:** Set at a 1:1 reward ratio (e.g., if risking 1%, take profit at +1% from entry).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Likely placed just below the recent swing low or the Keltner Channel midline to maintain the 1:1 risk-reward structure.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with the 1:1 risk-reward (e.g., 1% account risk per trade).  
- Avoid entries if funding rates are neutral/positive, as the contrarian edge is lost.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channel** (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width typical).  
2. **Perpetual Swap Funding Rate** data (must be negative and at least -0.1% annualized).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility expansion (Keltner breakout) with a contrarian sentiment filter (funding rates), targeting short squeezes or reversals in overly bearish markets.  

**Note:** Works best in high-liquidity crypto markets (e.g., BTC, ETH) where funding rates are reliable sentiment indicators.
