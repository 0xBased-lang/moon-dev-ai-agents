STRATEGY_NAME: BandDivergenceContraction  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (BB):**  
   - Upper and lower bands (typically 2 standard deviations from a 20-period SMA) define overbought/oversold zones.  
   - Bandwidth contraction (threshold crossing) signals reduced volatility and potential trend exhaustion.  

2. **Williams %R (14-period):**  
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows while %R forms higher lows (oversold < -80).  
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs while %R forms lower highs (overbought > -20).  

3. **Bandwidth Rolling Average (e.g., 10-period SMA):**  
   - Measures volatility compression; exits occur when current bandwidth crosses below this average.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Price touches or crosses the **lower BB**.  
  2. **Bullish %R divergence** confirmed (price lower low, %R higher low).  
  3. Enter at candle close or next open.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Price touches or crosses the **upper BB**.  
  2. **Bearish %R divergence** confirmed (price higher high, %R lower high).  
  3. Enter at candle close or next open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Bandwidth-Based Exit:** Close position when current BB bandwidth drops below its **10-period rolling average**.  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:**  
  - Longs: Recent swing low below lower BB.  
  - Shorts: Recent swing high above upper BB.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: 1â€“2% risk per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low volatility (bandwidth persistently below average).  
- Filter entries with higher timeframe trend alignment (e.g., only longs in uptrends per 50-period SMA).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2).  
2. Williams %R (14).  
3. Bandwidth rolling average (10-period SMA of bandwidth).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines mean-reversion (BB touch) with momentum confirmation (%R divergence) and volatility-based exits, reducing false signals in choppy markets.
