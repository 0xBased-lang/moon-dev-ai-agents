STRATEGY_NAME: ForceBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Donchian Channel Breakout:** The strategy uses the 10-day Donchian Channel (upper and lower bounds) to identify potential breakout levels.  
2. **Elder Force Index Confirmation:** A 50% surge in the Elder Force Index (a volume-weighted momentum indicator) is required to confirm the breakout signal.  
3. **ATR-Based Exit:** Positions are exited when price reverses by 2x the Average True Range (ATR) from the peak price after entry.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Price breaks above the 10-day Donchian Channel upper bound.  
  - The Elder Force Index shows a 50% increase from its previous value (indicating strong momentum).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Price breaks below the 10-day Donchian Channel lower bound.  
  - The Elder Force Index shows a 50% decrease from its previous value (indicating strong downward momentum).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - Price falls by 2x the current ATR value from the highest point reached after entry.  
- **Short Exit:**  
  - Price rises by 2x the current ATR value from the lowest point reached after entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** The 2x ATR reversal acts as a trailing stop-loss, dynamically adjusting to volatility.  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk per trade should be limited (e.g., 1-2% of capital) based on the ATR distance from entry to initial stop.  
- **Filtering:** Only take trades with high volume confirmation (Elder Force Index surge) to avoid false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Donchian Channel (10-day):** Defines breakout levels.  
2. **Elder Force Index:** Confirms momentum strength.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR):** Sets dynamic exit thresholds.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines price breakout (Donchian) with momentum confirmation (Elder Force Index).  
- Uses ATR for adaptive exits, scaling stop-losses with market volatility.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring a significant surge in buying/selling pressure.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different Donchian periods (e.g., 5-20 days) for varying market conditions.  
- Adjust the Elder Force Index threshold (e.g., 40-60%) to balance sensitivity and reliability.  
- Use a longer ATR period (e.g., 14 days) for smoother exits in trending markets.
