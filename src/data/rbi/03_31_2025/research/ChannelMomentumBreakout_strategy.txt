STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelMomentumBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with volatility contraction to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components work together to filter trades during optimal market conditions when volatility is compressing before an expansion.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period, 2xATR) - Identifies volatility contraction when channels narrow
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-period) - Measures trend strength and momentum
3. Signal Line (9-period SMA of CMO) - Provides crossover signals
4. Volume Filter (20-day SMA) - Confirms breakout participation

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- Keltner Channels show visible narrowing pattern
- CMO crosses ABOVE its signal line
- Current volume exceeds 20-day average volume
- Price closes above upper Keltner Channel

SHORT ENTRY:
- Keltner Channels show visible narrowing pattern
- CMO crosses BELOW its signal line
- Current volume exceeds 20-day average volume
- Price closes below lower Keltner Channel

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: When Keltner Channels begin expanding significantly (visual assessment)
- Stop Loss: Opposite Keltner Channel line (upper for shorts, lower for longs)
- Emergency Exit: When CMO crosses back over signal line in opposite direction

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss mandatory on all positions
3. Avoid trading during major news events when false breakouts are common
4. Only trade when all conditions align (no partial entries)

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2xATR multiplier)
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-period)
3. SMA (9-period) for CMO signal line
4. Volume with 20-period SMA overlay

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust ATR multiplier for Keltner Channels based on instrument volatility
- Test different CMO periods (14 is default) for various timeframes
- Volume filter can be adjusted to 10-30 day average depending on trading frequency

This strategy works best on 1-hour or 4-hour charts for swing trading, and requires patience to wait for the ideal volatility contraction setup before entries. The combination of momentum confirmation with volume-filtered breakouts provides a robust framework for catching meaningful moves while avoiding false breakouts.
