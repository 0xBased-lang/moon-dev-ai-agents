STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBreakoutADX

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation, momentum strength, and volatility-based exits for high-probability breakout trading.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification:
   - Uses the golden cross (50EMA > 200EMA) as primary trend confirmation
   - Requires ADX > 25 to confirm strong trending conditions

2. Entry Rules:
   - Enter long positions when:
     1. 50-period EMA crosses above 200-period EMA
     2. ADX reading is above 25 (confirming trend strength)
     3. Price breaks above recent high (breakout confirmation)

3. Exit Rules:
   - Protective Stop:
     - Placed at 2x ATR below entry price (volatility-adjusted)
   - Profit Taking:
     - Close position when 5-period RSI crosses below 70 (longs) or above 30 (shorts)
   - Alternative Exit:
     - Consider trailing stop at 1.5x ATR once in profit

4. Risk Management:
   - Position sizing based on 2x ATR stop distance
   - Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
   - No new entries if ADX begins declining below 25

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Moving Averages (50 & 200 periods)
2. Average Directional Index (ADX, 14-period default)
3. Average True Range (ATR, 14-period for stop calculation)
4. Relative Strength Index (RSI, 5-period for exits)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 4H or daily timeframes in trending markets
- Avoid trading during ADX values between 15-25 (weak trend)
- Combine with higher timeframe analysis for better context
- Works well in commodities and forex markets with strong trends

Optimization Considerations:
- Test different ADX thresholds (20-30 range)
- Experiment with RSI period length (3-7 periods)
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on market volatility (1.5-3x)
