STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFade  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation-Driven Fading:** The strategy capitalizes on overextended price spikes caused by liquidations, entering short when price breaches the upper Bollinger Band.  
2. **Volatility-Based Exit:** Exits occur when price retraces to the Keltner Channel midpoint and volatility contracts below its historical average.  
3. **Indicator Synergy:** Combines Bollinger Bands (volatility), Keltner Channels (trend), and liquidation volume data for high-probability mean-reversion trades.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Price breaches the upper Bollinger Band (typically set to 2 standard deviations).  
- **Condition 2:** Liquidation volume is significantly higher than recent average (e.g., 2x the 7-day median).  
- **Action:** Enter short at the close of the candle confirming the Bollinger Band breach.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** Close the short position when price crosses below the Keltner Channel midpoint (20-period EMA of typical price).  
- **Secondary Confirmation:** Volatility (measured by Bollinger Band width) must contract below its 20-period moving average.  
- **Emergency Stop:** Place a stop-loss above the recent swing high or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2%) above the entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Mandatory stop-loss to limit downside from continued liquidation cascades.  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if the Bollinger Band width is in the bottom 20% of its 3-month range (low volatility reduces edge).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Identifies overbought extremes.  
2. **Keltner Channel (20,1.5):** Midpoint acts as profit-taking level.  
3. **Liquidation Volume Data:** Confirms forced buying/selling pressure (requires on-chain or exchange API).  
4. **Bollinger Band Width MA (20):** Tracks volatility contraction for exits.  

**Unique Edge:** This strategy exploits the temporary nature of liquidation-induced moves, fading unsustainable spikes with clear volatility-based exits. The combination of liquidation volume and dual-channel confirmation reduces false signals.
