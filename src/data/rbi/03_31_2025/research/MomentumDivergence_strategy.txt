STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3):** Identifies overbought (>80) and oversold (<20) conditions.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** Confirms momentum with volume divergenceâ€”price makes higher highs while OBV makes lower highs (bearish divergence) or price makes lower lows while OBV makes higher lows (bullish divergence).  
3. **OBV Trendline:** Acts as the exit trigger when broken.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Stochastic crosses above 20 from oversold territory.  
  - Bullish OBV divergence (price lower low, OBV higher low).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Stochastic crosses below 80 from overbought territory.  
  - Bearish OBV divergence (price higher high, OBV lower high).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** OBV trendline (drawn from recent swing lows) breaks downward.  
- **Short Exit:** OBV trendline (drawn from recent swing highs) breaks upward.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss placed at the recent swing low (long) or swing high (short).  
- Position size capped at 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3).  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV).  
3. Trendline tool for OBV (manual drawing).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines price momentum (Stochastic) with volume confirmation (OBV divergence) for higher-probability reversals, while trendline breaks prevent premature exits.
