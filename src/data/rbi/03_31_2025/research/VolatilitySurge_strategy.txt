STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Identifies periods of extremely low volatility when the Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 6-month low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** Requires volume to spike above the 20-day average to validate the breakout signal, ensuring strong participation.  
3. **ATR-Based Exit:** Uses a 3x daily ATR (Average True Range) move to capture large volatility expansions while protecting profits.  
4. **Time-Based Exit:** Implements a 48-hour timeout to exit trades that fail to materialize, preventing prolonged exposure.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger Condition:** Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2) reaches its lowest level in the past 6 months.  
- **Confirmation Condition:** Volume exceeds the 20-day moving average of volume.  
- **Entry Action:** Enter a long position at the market price upon confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit/Stop-Loss Exit:** Exit the trade if price moves 3x the daily ATR in either direction (profit or loss).  
- **Time Exit:** Exit the trade after 48 hours if no ATR-based exit is triggered.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 3x ATR stop to ensure risk per trade aligns with overall portfolio limits.  
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause erratic volatility spikes unrelated to the setup.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) – To calculate Bandwidth (Upper Band - Lower Band / Middle Band).  
2. Volume 20-day Moving Average – To confirm volume surge.  
3. Daily ATR (14-period recommended) – For exit conditions.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Backtest across multiple asset classes to confirm robustness.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (3x) based on volatility preferences.  

This strategy capitalizes on volatility expansion after extreme compression, with volume acting as a key filter for high-probability breakouts.
