STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReverser

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on detecting liquidation cluster levels using on-chain leverage data
- Identifies volatility contraction through Bollinger Band Width (5-day low)
- Targets reversal trades at key liquidity zones
- Uses opposing cluster zones for profit-taking

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for price to reach a pre-identified liquidation cluster level (from on-chain leverage data)
- Confirm volatility contraction when Bollinger Band Width reaches 5-day low
- Enter reversal trade when price breaches the volatility contraction threshold
- Position direction should be opposite of the prevailing trend into the liquidation zone

3. Exit Rules:
- Set profit targets at opposing liquidation cluster zones
- Consider partial exits at intermediate liquidity levels
- Implement stop-loss beyond the initial liquidation cluster level
- Exit if Bollinger Band Width expands significantly beyond entry threshold

4. Risk Management:
- Position size should account for distance to opposing cluster zone
- Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events that may disrupt liquidity patterns
- Monitor on-chain leverage changes that may invalidate cluster zones

5. Required Indicators:
- On-chain leverage data (exchange-specific liquidation levels)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard settings) with Width calculation
- 5-day rolling minimum of Bollinger Band Width
- Price levels corresponding to significant liquidation clusters

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets with clear liquidity zones
- Requires frequent monitoring of on-chain data updates
- Most effective on liquid assets with high leverage trading activity
- Timeframe agnostic but typically used on 4h-1d charts for reliability

This strategy capitalizes on market maker behavior around liquidation levels, using volatility contraction as confirmation of potential reversal points. The unique combination of on-chain liquidation data with technical volatility measurements creates a high-probability reversal trading approach.
