STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Breakout:** Measures volatility expansion when the band width (difference between upper and lower bands) exceeds a threshold, signaling potential trend acceleration.  
2. **VWAP Divergence:** Identifies discrepancies between price and volume-weighted average price (VWAP), confirming momentum shifts.  
3. **VWAP Reversion:** Exit signal triggered when price retraces to the VWAP, indicating loss of momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width expands beyond its 20-period average (volatility breakout).  
  2. Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band while VWAP slopes upward (bullish divergence).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width expands beyond its 20-period average.  
  2. Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band while VWAP slopes downward (bearish divergence).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Price crosses below the VWAP or Bollinger Band width contracts below its 20-period average.  
- **Short Exit:** Price crosses above the VWAP or Bollinger Band width contracts below its 20-period average.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss placed at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry.  
- Position size capped at 2% of capital per trade.  
- No trades during low-volume periods (volume < 50% of 20-day average).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).  
2. VWAP (session-based).  
3. ATR (14-period for stop calculation).  
4. Volume oscillator (to filter low-volume conditions).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility expansion (Bollinger Width) with volume-confirmed momentum (VWAP divergence), filtering false breakouts via volume and mean reversion to VWAP.
