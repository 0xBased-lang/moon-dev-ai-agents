STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **EMA Crossover Signal**: The strategy uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as the primary trend confirmation.  
2. **Volume Confirmation**: A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a volume spike exceeding the 20-day average volume, ensuring strong participation.  
3. **ATR-Based Risk Management**: Uses Average True Range (ATR) for dynamic stop-loss and trailing stop placement, adapting to market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  - The 50-period EMA crosses above the 200-period EMA (bullish crossover).  
  - Volume on the breakout candle exceeds the 20-day average volume.  
- Entry is triggered at the close of the breakout candle.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: Exit the trade if price moves against the position by 2x the current ATR value from the entry price.  
2. **Trailing Stop**: Adjust the stop-loss to 1.5x ATR below the highest price reached since entry (for long positions).  
3. **Optional Exit**: Consider closing the trade if the 50-period EMA crosses back below the 200-period EMA (death cross).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade based on the 2x ATR stop-loss distance.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or when ATR values are abnormally high (indicating excessive volatility).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
2. **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
3. **20-day Average Volume** (for volume spike confirmation)  
4. **Average True Range (ATR)** (14-period recommended for stop calculations)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines the reliability of EMA crossovers with volume confirmation to filter false breakouts.  
- Uses ATR for adaptive risk management, making it suitable for varying market conditions.  
- The name "VolumetricBreakout" reflects the critical role of volume in validating the breakout alongside the EMA crossover.
