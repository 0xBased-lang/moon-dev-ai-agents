STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Analysis - Uses orderbook delta data to identify high liquidation zones where price is likely to experience breakout momentum
2. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction - Requires compression of volatility as confirmation signal before entry
3. Volatility Quantile Thresholds - Uses historical rolling volatility measurements to determine exit points

Entry Rules:
1. Identify high liquidation clusters in orderbook delta data (top 5% of historical liquidation density)
2. Wait for price to approach within 1.5% of identified liquidation zone
3. Confirm Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) has contracted below its 20-period moving average
4. Enter long on breakout above liquidation zone or short on breakdown below

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor 14-period historical volatility (HV)
2. Close position when current HV exceeds 90th percentile of rolling 100-period HV distribution
3. Alternative exit: 2:1 reward/risk ratio achieved

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placed at opposite side of liquidation zone (for longs: below cluster low; for shorts: above cluster high)
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 3% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. Orderbook delta liquidation heatmap
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) for bandwidth calculation
3. 14-period historical volatility
4. Rolling 100-period volatility quantile calculator

Optimization Notes:
- Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
- Works particularly well during NY/London overlap sessions
- Requires liquid markets with visible orderbook data
- Backtest suggested parameters: 0.8-1.2% buffer around liquidation zones for optimal entries
