STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityLiquidation  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines extreme funding rate deviations with volatility-based technical triggers and order book analysis to identify high-probability short opportunities in perpetual futures markets.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Funding Rate Extremes** - Triggers when funding rates exceed 3 standard deviations above the 7-day average, indicating excessive long leverage.  
2. **Volatility-Adjusted Bollinger Bands** - Uses modified Bollinger Bands (likely with dynamic deviation multipliers) to confirm overextended price action.  
3. **Liquidation Targeting** - Order book heatmaps identify dense liquidation clusters (price levels with high concentration of stop-loss orders).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- SHORT when:  
  1) Current funding rate > 3σ of 7-day average funding rate  
  2) Price breaches upper volatility-adjusted Bollinger Band  
  3) Order book heatmap shows dense liquidation clusters above current price  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take Profit: Near identified liquidation clusters (scaled exits as price approaches key levels)  
- Stop Loss: Breach of lower volatility-adjusted Bollinger Band or funding rate normalization (<1σ from mean)  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on distance to liquidation clusters (wider clusters allow larger size)  
- Volatility filters (avoid entries during low historical volatility periods)  
- Time-based exit if no liquidation occurs within 24 hours  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Funding rate standard deviation calculator (7-day lookback)  
2. Modified Bollinger Bands with dynamic width adjustment  
3. Order book liquidity heatmap (aggregates resting orders + estimated stop levels)  
4. Volatility percentile rank (50-day window)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines CEX-specific metrics (funding) with exchange-agnostic technicals  
- Targets mechanical rather than discretionary exits via liquidation engineering  
- Volatility adjustments prevent false signals during high-vol regimes  

Note: Requires real-time funding rate data feed and order book depth analysis capabilities. Works best on high-liquidity perpetual contracts (BTC, ETH majors).
