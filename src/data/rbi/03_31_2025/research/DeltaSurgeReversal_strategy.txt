STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaSurgeReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cascade Detection**: Identifies short-term market reversals triggered by liquidation events using order book delta imbalances (buy/sell pressure divergence).  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation**: Requires a surge in trading volume exceeding the 90th percentile of recent volume to validate the liquidation signal.  
3. **Fibonacci Retracement Exits**: Uses key Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) as profit-taking zones for the reversal trade.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a **long position** when:  
  1. Order book delta shows a sharp negative imbalance (indicating forced selling/liquidations).  
  2. Volume spikes above the 90th percentile of the last 50-100 periods, confirming panic selling exhaustion.  
- Enter a **short position** when:  
  1. Order book delta shows a sharp positive imbalance (indicating forced buying/short squeezes).  
  2. Volume spikes above the 90th percentile, confirming overbought conditions.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**: Scale out at Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) from the initial liquidation swing.  
- **Stop Loss**: Place below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the swing high (for shorts) to limit downside.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk â‰¤ 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Stop loss must be triggered before volume confirmation weakens.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to prevent false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Order Book Delta Imbalance** (real-time bid/ask flow analysis).  
2. **Volume Surge Filter** (90th percentile threshold).  
3. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool** (applied to the liquidation swing).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines order flow dynamics with statistical volume extremes to exploit high-probability reversal setups post-liquidation events.
