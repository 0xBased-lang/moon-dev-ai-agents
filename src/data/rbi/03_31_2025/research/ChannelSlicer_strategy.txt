STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Donchian Channel Breakout:** Uses the 20-day Donchian Channel (high/low range) to identify potential breakout points.  
2. **Choppiness Index Filter:** Confirms low-range consolidation when the Choppiness Index (CI) drops below 35, indicating a trending environment.  
3. **Renko Box Trailing Stop:** Manages exits using Renko box reversals to lock in profits while allowing for trend continuation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Price closes above the upper 20-day Donchian Channel, AND the Choppiness Index is below 35.  
- **Short Entry:** Price closes below the lower 20-day Donchian Channel, AND the Choppiness Index is below 35.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit when a Renko box reversal occurs (e.g., a new Renko box forms in the opposite direction).  
- **Emergency Stop:** Fixed stop-loss at 2x the average Renko box size if the trailing stop is too wide.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading if the Choppiness Index is above 35 (indicating choppy, non-trending markets).  
- Only trade breakouts with volume confirmation for higher reliability.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **20-Day Donchian Channel** (Upper & Lower Bands).  
2. **Choppiness Index (CI)** (14-period default).  
3. **Renko Chart Setup** (for trailing stop execution).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid sideways conditions.  
- Renko box size should be optimized per asset (e.g., ATR-based).  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for stronger signals.  

This strategy combines breakout momentum with volatility contraction, using Renko for clean trend-following exits.
