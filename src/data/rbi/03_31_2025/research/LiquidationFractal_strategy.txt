STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFractal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation zone analysis with Fibonacci cluster confirmation to identify high-probability reversal opportunities in volatile markets. The approach focuses on three key components:

1. Liquidation Heatmap Analysis:
- Monitor exchange-provided liquidation heatmaps to identify dense clusters of liquidation levels
- Prioritize zones where both long and short liquidations are concentrated
- Validate zones with higher timeframe significance (daily/weekly levels)

2. Fibonacci Cluster Confirmation:
- Draw Fibonacci retracement from recent swing high to swing low (or vice versa)
- Look for confluences where multiple Fib levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) align with liquidation zones
- Require at least 2 Fib levels to cluster within 0.5% of liquidation zone

3. ATR-Based Risk Management:
- Calculate 14-period ATR on the timeframe you're trading
- Set initial stop loss at 1.5x ATR beyond the liquidation zone
- Trail stop to breakeven when price moves 1x ATR in your favor
- Take partial profits at 1x ATR and 2x ATR levels

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to approach identified liquidation zone (within 0.5%)
2. Confirm Fibonacci cluster alignment (minimum 2 levels)
3. Require rejection candle pattern (pinbar, engulfing, etc.) at the zone
4. Enter on break of rejection candle high/low with 50% position
5. Add remaining 50% on retest of zone if occurs

Exit Rules:
1. Initial target: 1x ATR (take 50% position off)
2. Secondary target: 2x ATR (close remaining position)
3. Emergency exit if price closes beyond 1.5x ATR stop level
4. Trail stop to breakeven once 1x ATR profit achieved

Required Indicators:
1. Exchange liquidation heatmap data
2. Fibonacci retracement tool
3. 14-period ATR
4. Volume profile (optional confirmation)

Risk Management:
1. Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
2. Maximum 3 concurrent trades
3. Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
4. Adjust position size based on ATR value
5. Daily loss limit of 5% account equity

This strategy excels in volatile market conditions where liquidation cascades create exaggerated moves that often reverse sharply. The combination of liquidation zones with Fibonacci clusters provides high-probability reversal areas, while the ATR-based stops adapt to current market volatility.
