STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityThreshold  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Filter:** Uses the 20-day Average True Range (ATR) to identify low-volatility conditions when it drops below its 10th percentile (historically calculated).  
2. **Trend Confirmation:** Requires price to cross above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to ensure alignment with a broader uptrend.  
3. **Exit Mechanism:** Combines a trailing stop-loss (2x ATR) and a time-based exit (5-day holding period) to lock in profits or limit losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry Trigger:**  
  1. The 20-day ATR must fall below its 10th percentile (indicating unusually low volatility).  
  2. Price must close above the 200-day SMA (confirming bullish momentum).  
- Both conditions must be met simultaneously for a trade entry.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop-Loss Exit:** A dynamic trailing stop set at 2x the current 20-day ATR value from the entry price.  
- **Time-Based Exit:** Automatically exits the trade after 5 trading days, regardless of profit/loss.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop to limit risk per trade (e.g., risking 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during major news events that could spike volatility unexpectedly.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **20-day ATR:** To measure volatility and identify the 10th percentile threshold.  
2. **200-day SMA:** For trend confirmation.  
3. **Historical Percentile Calculation:** To determine the 10th percentile ATR level (requires backtesting or rolling window analysis).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines mean-reversion (low ATR) with trend-following (SMA crossover).  
- Dual exit logic balances short-term profit-taking and volatility protection.  
- Avoids choppy markets by filtering for low volatility before trend entries.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different ATR percentiles (e.g., 5th or 15th) for sensitivity adjustments.  
- Experiment with SMA periods (e.g., 100-day or 50-day) for varying trend horizons.
