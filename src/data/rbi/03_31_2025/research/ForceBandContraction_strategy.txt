STRATEGY_NAME: ForceBand Contraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Components:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period) - measures buying/selling pressure combining price and volume
2. Force Index 3-day SMA - smoothed version for crossover signals
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - standard deviation-based volatility channels
4. Band Width - measures contraction/expansion of Bollinger Bands

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Elder Force Index crosses ABOVE its 3-day SMA
2. Confirmation: Bollinger Band Width must be below its 20-period average (contraction phase)
3. Execution: Enter long on close above upper Bollinger Band
   Enter short on close below lower Bollinger Band

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Opposite Bollinger Band touch
   - Long exits when price touches lower band
   - Short exits when price touches upper band
2. Stop Loss: 2x ATR (14) from entry price
3. Time Exit: Close position after 5 bars if not exited

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Volatility filter: Only trade when ATR(14) > 0.5% of price
3. Maximum daily trades: 3 per instrument
4. Correlation limit: No more than 2 similar positions open

Required Indicators:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period)
2. Simple Moving Average (3-period) of Force Index
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
4. Bollinger Band Width (20-period average)
5. ATR (14) for stop placement

Optimization Notes:
- Test different Force Index periods (8-15)
- Experiment with Bollinger Band deviations (1.8-2.2)
- Adjust contraction threshold (try 15-25 period BW average)

This strategy combines momentum confirmation (Force Index crossover) with volatility contraction (Bollinger Band Width) for high-probability breakout trades, exiting at mean-reversion points (opposite band touches). The dual confirmation reduces false breakouts while capitalizing on emerging trends.
