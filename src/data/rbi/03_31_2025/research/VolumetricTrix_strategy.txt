STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricTrix  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines the TRIX oscillator's bullish crossover signal with a significant surge in trading volume to identify high-probability long entries, while using an adaptive ATR-based trailing stop for dynamic exits.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **TRIX Crossover:** Uses the TRIX (Triple Exponential Moving Average) oscillator to detect momentum shifts. A bullish signal occurs when TRIX crosses above zero.  
2. **Volume Surge Filter:** Requires trading volume to be at least 1.5x the 20-day average volume, confirming strong participation in the price move.  
3. **ATR Trailing Stop:** Implements a dynamic exit mechanism based on Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits while allowing room for price fluctuations.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  - TRIX (default 15-period) crosses above the zero line.  
  - Current trading volume exceeds 1.5x the 20-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Use a trailing stop based on ATR (default 14-period):  
  - Set the initial stop at [Entry Price - (2 x ATR)].  
  - Adjust the stop upward as price moves in your favor, maintaining a 2x ATR distance below the highest price reached since entry.  
- Exit the trade when price hits the trailing stop level.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the ATR-based stop distance to ensure risk per trade aligns with your risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid entering trades if the volume surge is accompanied by extreme volatility (e.g., gap-ups or news-driven spikes).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. TRIX (15-period recommended)  
2. Volume (20-day average)  
3. ATR (14-period recommended)  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different TRIX periods (e.g., 12 or 18) to match your trading timeframe.  
- Adjust the volume multiplier (e.g., 1.3x or 2x) based on the asset's typical volume patterns.  
- Fine-tune the ATR multiplier (e.g., 1.5x or 2.5x) for tighter or looser stops.  

This strategy is ideal for swing traders seeking momentum plays with confirmed volume support, while the ATR trailing stop ensures disciplined risk management.
