STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bandwidth contraction with Donchian Channel breakout signals, specifically triggered by volume-weighted conditions and exited using ATR-based volatility measurements.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted Bollinger Bandwidth (10-day)
2. Donchian Channel (default 20-period)
3. Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)
4. 1-year lookback period for bandwidth extremes

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- When 10-day volume-weighted Bollinger Bandwidth reaches its lowest point in 1 year (showing extreme contraction)
- AND price breaks ABOVE the Donchian Channel upper band

SHORT ENTRY:
- When 10-day volume-weighted Bollinger Bandwidth reaches its lowest point in 1 year
- AND price breaks BELOW the Donchian Channel lower band

Exit Rules:
- LONG POSITION: Exit when price falls 3x ATR from the highest point since entry
- SHORT POSITION: Exit when price rises 3x ATR from the lowest point since entry

Risk Management:
1. The 3x ATR exit serves as both profit-taking and stop-loss mechanism
2. Consider position sizing based on ATR to maintain consistent risk
3. Only trade when bandwidth reaches statistically significant lows (1-year extreme)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations) with volume weighting
2. Donchian Channel (20-period recommended)
3. Average True Range (14-period recommended)
4. Volume data for weighting calculations

Unique Aspects:
- Combines volatility contraction (Bollinger Bandwidth) with breakout confirmation (Donchian)
- Uses volume-weighting for more significant squeeze detection
- Employs ATR-based dynamic exits rather than fixed targets
- Requires annual extremes for higher probability setups

Optimization Notes:
- Test different periods for Bollinger Bandwidth calculation (10-day vs others)
- Experiment with Donchian Channel lengths
- Adjust ATR multiplier (3x) based on market conditions
- Consider adding volume confirmation on breakout day
