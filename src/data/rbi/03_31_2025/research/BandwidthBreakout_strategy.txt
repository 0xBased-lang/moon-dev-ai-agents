STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on identifying consolidation periods through Bollinger Band width contraction
- Uses volume surge (above 20-period average) as confirmation signal
- Trades breakouts when price closes outside Bollinger Bands
- Employs dynamic 2x ATR trailing stops for exit management

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for Bollinger Band width to narrow significantly (indicating consolidation)
- Monitor for volume spike exceeding 20-period moving average
- Enter long when price closes above upper Bollinger Band
- Enter short when price closes below lower Bollinger Band
- Both conditions (band breakout + volume confirmation) must be met

3. Exit Rules:
- Initial stop placed at 2x ATR from entry point
- Trailing stop maintains 2x ATR distance as trade progresses
- Exit when price touches the trailing stop level
- No profit targets - let the trailing stop capture maximum trend potential

4. Risk Management:
- Position size should be calculated based on stop distance and account risk tolerance
- Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of account
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts
- Consider implementing a maximum holding period if desired

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (standard 20-period, 2 standard deviation settings)
- Bollinger Band Width indicator (to measure contraction)
- Volume indicator with 20-period moving average
- Average True Range (ATR, 14-period recommended) for stop calculation

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes for swing trading
- More reliable in trending market conditions
- Requires patience to wait for proper setups (narrow bands + volume confirmation)
- Backtest suggested for parameter optimization on specific instruments
- Consider filtering trades with overall market direction for improved performance
