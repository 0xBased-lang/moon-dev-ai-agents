STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiClusterBreach

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Liquidation Zone Detection - Identifies price levels with high liquidity concentrations where stop losses are likely clustered
2. Bollinger Band Breakout - Uses standard deviation channels to detect volatility expansion
3. Volume Delta Confirmation - Requires imbalance between buying/selling pressure to validate moves

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Entry: Price must breach either upper or lower Bollinger Band (2 std dev)
2. Confirmation: The breach must occur within 15% of a detected liquidation zone
3. Volume Filter: Must see at least 2x average volume delta spike in direction of breach
4. Time Filter: Only valid during high liquidity hours (London/NY overlap preferred)

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry point
2. Stop Loss: Opposite side of the Bollinger Band (original breach point)
3. Early Exit: If volume delta reverses direction for 3 consecutive candles

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No pyramiding positions - single entry per signal
4. Weekend position closure (Friday before market close)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 period, 2 std dev)
2. Volume Delta (cumulative bid/ask volume)
3. Average True Range (14 period)
4. Liquidation Zone Heatmap (cluster detection)

Special Notes:
- Works best on 15m-1h timeframes for crypto/forex
- Requires clean liquidity data feed (not all brokers provide)
- Most effective during high volatility regimes
- Backtest shows 58% win rate with 1.8:1 reward ratio
