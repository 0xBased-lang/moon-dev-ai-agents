STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicCompression

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band width contraction with ADX trend strength to identify high-probability trading opportunities during periods of volatility compression and weakening trend momentum.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) - Measures volatility contraction
2. ADX (14-period) - Identifies trend strength
3. Price action confirmation - Validates breakout signals

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below 0.5 (indicating volatility compression)
2. Simultaneously, ADX must be below 25 (showing weakening trend momentum)
3. Enter long when price breaks above upper Bollinger Band with confirmation candle close
4. Enter short when price breaks below lower Bollinger Band with confirmation candle close

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Exit when price closes below middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
2. For short positions: Exit when price closes above middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
3. Alternative exit: Trail stop at opposite Bollinger Band level

Risk Management:
1. Position size: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss: Place initial stop beyond opposite Bollinger Band
3. Profit target: 2:1 risk-reward ratio minimum
4. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. ADX (14)
3. Bollinger Band Width indicator (for measuring contraction)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes in trending markets
- Works well with liquid currency pairs and major indices
- Combine with volume confirmation for higher probability signals
- Avoid using during extremely low volatility periods (ADX < 15)

This strategy capitalizes on the tendency for periods of low volatility (Bollinger contraction) to precede significant moves, while the ADX filter helps avoid false breakouts in strong trending markets.
