STRATEGY_NAME: VwapForceBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted price analysis with momentum confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components are:

1. KEY INDICATORS:
- 20-period VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): Acts as dynamic support/resistance
- Elder's Force Index (13-period recommended): Measures buying/selling pressure combining price and volume
- Price action: For breakout confirmation

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Long Entry: When price crosses ABOVE 20-period VWAP AND Elder's Force Index shows significant positive momentum (suggested: > +0.5 or breaking above its own moving average)
- Short Entry: When price crosses BELOW 20-period VWAP AND Elder's Force Index shows significant negative momentum (suggested: < -0.5 or breaking below its own moving average)

3. EXIT RULES:
- Take Profit: 2:1 risk-reward ratio (target = 2x initial risk)
- Stop Loss: Price closing back below (for longs) or above (for shorts) the 20-period VWAP
- Emergency Exit: If Elder's Force Index reverses direction sharply (e.g., crosses zero line)

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size should be calculated based on distance between entry and stop loss
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of account
- Avoid trading during low volume periods when VWAP may be less reliable

5. FILTERS FOR HIGHER QUALITY TRADES:
- Look for breakouts that occur with above-average volume
- Prefer breakouts that align with the broader trend (e.g., long breakouts in uptrends)
- Wait for price to close beyond VWAP for confirmation

6. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Works best on liquid assets with good volume patterns
- More effective on 1-hour or 4-hour charts for swing trading
- Adjust VWAP period based on trading style (shorter for day trading)

This strategy leverages the confluence of institutional price levels (VWAP) with professional momentum analysis (Force Index) to identify breakouts with higher probability of continuation. The 2:1 reward ratio ensures positive expectancy over time.
