STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSuperTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend-following with momentum confirmation and volume validation for high-probability entries. The core components are:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- SuperTrend indicator (primary trend filter)
- Stochastic RSI (momentum confirmation)
- Volume analysis (entry validation)
- Trend-following exit system

2. ENTRY RULES (Long Only):
- SuperTrend must flip from bearish to bullish (color change)
- Stochastic RSI must cross above 20 (exiting oversold)
- Stochastic RSI must be rising (positive momentum)
- Current volume must be higher than 20-period average
- All conditions must occur on same candle

3. EXIT RULES:
- Primary exit: When SuperTrend flips back to bearish
- Optional emergency exit: If price closes below recent swing low

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size: 1-2% of capital per trade
- Stop loss: Below recent swing low or 1.5x ATR
- Take profit: None (let SuperTrend ride the trend)
- Maximum portfolio exposure: 5-10% at any time

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- SuperTrend (default 10,3 settings)
- Stochastic RSI (14,3,3,20/80 levels)
- Volume (20-period moving average)
- Optional: ATR (14) for stop calculation

6. SPECIAL NOTES:
- Works best in trending markets (avoid ranging conditions)
- Higher timeframes (4H/Daily) reduce false signals
- Volume confirmation reduces whipsaw entries
- Combine with fundamental/macro trend alignment for best results

This strategy capitalizes on confirmed trend reversals with built-in momentum and volume filters to avoid false breakouts while riding trends until the SuperTrend indicates reversal.
