STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by high-momentum breakouts, using a unique nested volatility channel configuration with confirmation from trend strength indicators.

Key Components:
1. Nested Volatility Channels:
   - Primary: Keltner Channels (20-period EMA with 2.5x ATR width)
   - Secondary: Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) inside Keltner
2. Breakout Confirmation:
   - ADX (14-period) must surge above 30 within 3 bars of breakout
3. Exit Mechanism:
   - Parabolic SAR (0.02 step, 0.2 max) trailing stop
   - Dynamic adjustment based on volatility contraction/expansion cycles

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Price must be consolidating inside Bollinger Bands for â‰¥5 periods
2. Bollinger Bands must be entirely within Keltner Channels (contraction)
3. Breakout above upper Bollinger Band
4. ADX crosses above 30 within 3 bars of breakout
5. Volume must be above 20-period average on breakout bar

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Mirror image of long rules
2. Breakout below lower Bollinger Band
3. ADX confirmation applies equally

Exit Rules:
1. Primary: Parabolic SAR reversal
2. Secondary: 
   - If Bollinger Band width expands to >150% of entry width
   - If price re-enters Keltner Channel after breakout
3. Emergency: 2% of account hard stop (hidden)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Volatility-adjusted stops:
   - Initial stop at 1.5x entry bar's ATR
   - Trailing stop activates after 1R profit
3. Contraction Quality Filter:
   - Only trade if Bollinger width is <50% of Keltner width
   - Minimum 5-period contraction before breakout

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channel (20EMA, 2.5ATR)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
3. ADX (14) with +DI/-DI lines
4. Parabolic SAR (0.02, 0.2)
5. Volume average (20)
6. ATR (14) for stop calculation

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 1H-4H timeframes
2. Works across forex, commodities, and indices
3. Requires minimum 30-period contraction for high-probability setups
4. Combine with fundamental catalysts for best results

This "VoltaicContraction" strategy uniquely combines the reliability of nested volatility channels with the momentum confirmation of ADX, creating high-probability trades during market inflection points. The dynamic exit system preserves gains during extended trends while protecting against false breakouts.
