STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a volatility-based mean-reversion strategy that combines VWAP anchoring with ATR volatility bands and RSI confirmation. The strategy capitalizes on overextended price movements relative to the volume-weighted average price, with built-in momentum filters.

Key Components:
1. VWAP (20-period) - Serves as the dynamic mean anchor
2. ATR (default 14-period) - Measures volatility for band calculation
3. RSI (default 14-period) - Provides momentum confirmation
4. Volume - Used to confirm exit signals

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- Price crosses ABOVE VWAP + (2 × ATR)
- RSI must be below 70 (avoid overbought conditions)

SHORT ENTRY:
- Price crosses BELOW VWAP - (2 × ATR)
- RSI must be above 30 (avoid oversold conditions)

Exit Rules:
LONG EXIT:
- RSI crosses below 50 (momentum weakening)
- AND Volume is decreasing for 2 consecutive bars

SHORT EXIT:
- RSI crosses above 50 (momentum weakening)
- AND Volume is decreasing for 2 consecutive bars

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placed at 1.5×ATR from entry point
3. Time-based exit if no signal occurs within 5 bars
4. Maximum 3 concurrent positions

Indicator Settings:
- VWAP: 20 period
- ATR: 14 period (used for both bands and stops)
- RSI: 14 period
- Volume: 20-period MA for trend comparison

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5-3x) based on asset volatility
2. VWAP period can be tuned (10-30 periods)
3. Consider adding a minimum volume filter for entries
4. Test different RSI thresholds for exits (45-55)

This strategy works best in ranging markets with clear mean-reversion tendencies. Performance may degrade during strong trending periods, suggesting the need for a trend filter or time-based position limits.
