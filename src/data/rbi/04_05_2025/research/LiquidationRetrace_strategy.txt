STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationRetrace  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cascade Detection:** Identifies potential long opportunities by monitoring sudden drops in open interest (OI) combined with extreme negative funding rates, signaling forced liquidations and potential market overselling.  
2. **Bollinger Band Midline Retracement:** Uses the Bollinger Band midline (typically the 20-period SMA) as a profit-taking exit point, capitalizing on mean reversion after liquidation-driven price drops.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger Condition:** A sharp decline in open interest (e.g., >10% drop within a short timeframe) paired with a deeply negative funding rate (e.g., below -0.1%).  
- **Confirmation:** Price should show signs of stabilization or a bullish reversal candle (e.g., hammer, engulfing) post-cascade.  
- **Entry Action:** Enter a long position at the close of the confirmation candle or on a break above its high.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit the trade when price reaches the Bollinger Band midline (20-period SMA).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below the entry price to limit downside risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for volatility (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to prevent slippage.  
- Monitor funding rates post-entry; if they remain excessively negative, consider early exit to avoid prolonged adverse conditions.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Open Interest (OI):** Tracked via exchange data or derivatives platforms.  
2. **Funding Rate:** Real-time funding rate from perpetual swap markets.  
3. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Midline (20-period SMA) acts as the exit guide.  
4. **Price Action Tools:** Candlestick patterns for confirmation (optional but recommended).  

**Unique Edge:**  
This strategy exploits market overreactions from liquidations, combining derivatives metrics (OI/funding) with technical mean reversion for high-probability counter-trend entries. The Bollinger midline exit ensures disciplined profit-taking before potential resistance.  

**Note:** Backtest for asset-specific OI/funding thresholds and adjust stop/exit parameters based on volatility (e.g., wider bands for high-beta assets).
