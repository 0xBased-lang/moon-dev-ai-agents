STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationClusterReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy specializes in identifying high-probability counter-trend opportunities by monitoring liquidation clusters and volatility conditions. The approach combines liquidation analytics with volume-weighted price action for precise entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Analysis (Primary Trigger)
   - Monitors liquidation levels exceeding 2 standard deviations from 30-day average
   - Requires clusters (multiple liquidations at similar levels) for confirmation

2. Volatility Filters (ATR-Based)
   - Uses Average True Range to gauge market conditions
   - Requires volatility contraction before entry
   - Uses volatility expansion for exit signals

3. VWAP Confirmation
   - Volume-Weighted Average Price acts as dynamic support/resistance
   - Opposing liquidations must cross VWAP for exit confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger:
   - Liquidation clusters must exceed +2 STD (for short entries) or -2 STD (for long entries) of 30-day average
   - Cluster must contain minimum 3 significant liquidation events

2. Confirmation:
   - Current price must be at/near liquidation cluster level
   - ATR(14) must be below its 20-period moving average (volatility contraction)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - When ATR(14) expands beyond its 20-period MA by 15%
   - AND opposing liquidation activity crosses VWAP

2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop placed at 1.5x ATR from entry
   - Trailing stop activates at 0.5x ATR beyond breakeven

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum 2% risk per trade
   - Adjust position size based on ATR (volatility-adjusted sizing)

2. Trade Frequency:
   - Maximum 2 concurrent positions
   - Minimum 24-hour cooldown between trades in same direction

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation Heatmap (custom)
2. ATR (14-period)
3. VWAP (daily)
4. Standard Deviation (30-day) of liquidation levels

Special Notes:
- Works best in trending markets with periodic overextensions
- Requires high-quality liquidation data feed
- Most effective on 4H-1D timeframes
- Performs poorly during low-liquidity periods or news events

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust STD multiplier (1.8-2.2 range) based on asset volatility
- Test different ATR period lengths (10-20) for volatility filter
- Consider adding RSI(3) <20/>80 as additional confirmation for extreme moves
