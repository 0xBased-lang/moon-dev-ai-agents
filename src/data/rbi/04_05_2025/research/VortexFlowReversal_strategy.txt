STRATEGY_NAME: VortexFlow Reversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI)**: Used to confirm the prevailing trend direction.  
   - **VI+ (Positive Vortex)**: Indicates bullish trend strength.  
   - **VI- (Negative Vortex)**: Indicates bearish trend strength.  
2. **Exchange Inflow/Outflow Volumes**: Tracks sudden surges in volume movements to/from exchanges, signaling potential reversals.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR) Bands**: Dynamically adjusts stop-loss levels based on market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Bullish Reversal Entry**:  
   - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish confirmation).  
   - Surge in exchange inflow volume (indicating accumulation).  
   - Price closes above the lower ATR band (volatility support).  
2. **Bearish Reversal Entry**:  
   - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish confirmation).  
   - Surge in exchange outflow volume (indicating distribution).  
   - Price closes below the upper ATR band (volatility resistance).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take-Profit**:  
   - Fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).  
   - Or exit when VI+ and VI- converge (trend weakening).  
2. **Stop-Loss**:  
   - Bullish trade: Exit if price closes below the lower ATR band.  
   - Bearish trade: Exit if price closes above the upper ATR band.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on ATR (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
2. Avoid trading during low-volume periods to prevent false signals.  
3. Filter entries with a minimum exchange volume threshold (e.g., 20% above 30-day average).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI).  
2. Exchange Inflow/Outflow Volume data (e.g., from Glassnode, CryptoQuant).  
3. Average True Range (ATR) with upper/lower bands (e.g., ATR * 1.5).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (VI) with on-chain volume surges for high-probability reversals.  
- Uses dynamic ATR bands for adaptive stop-loss placement.  
- Focuses on exchange flows to detect institutional or whale activity.  

**Note:** This strategy works best in volatile markets with clear trends. Backtest with multiple assets to validate robustness.
