STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Identifies trend direction and potential reversals. A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-, while a bearish signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+.  
2. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** Measures momentum strength. Divergence between price and CMO (e.g., price makes a higher high while CMO makes a lower high) confirms weakening momentum, reinforcing reversal signals.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires volume spikes above the 20-day moving average to validate entries, ensuring strong participation in the move.  
4. **Keltner Channels:** Used for exits—breakouts outside the channels signal trend exhaustion or continuation, depending on direction.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend initiation).  
  2. Bearish divergence on CMO (price higher high, CMO lower high).  
  3. Volume exceeds 20-day average.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend initiation).  
  2. Bullish divergence on CMO (price lower low, CMO higher low).  
  3. Volume exceeds 20-day average.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Price closes below the lower Keltner Channel.  
- **Short Exit:** Price closes above the upper Keltner Channel.  
- Optional: Trail stops using Keltner Channel mid-line for trend continuation.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk ≤1-2% per trade.  
- Stop-loss: Place below recent swing low (long) or above swing high (short) for volatility-adjusted protection.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic events to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO, default 14-period).  
3. Volume 20-day moving average.  
4. Keltner Channels (typical settings: 20-period EMA, 2x ATR multiplier).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend-following (Vortex) with momentum divergence (CMO) and volume confirmation, filtered by volatility-based exits (Keltner). High-probability reversals with reduced whipsaws.
