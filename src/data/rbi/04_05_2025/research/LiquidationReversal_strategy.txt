STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on identifying potential reversal points near liquidation cluster zones (areas with high concentration of stop orders)
- Uses Heikin-Ashi candles on 4-hour timeframe to confirm exhaustion patterns
- Combines order flow analysis (liquidation data) with price action confirmation

2. Entry Rules:
- Identify liquidation cluster zones using aggregated futures liquidations data
- Wait for price to approach the identified liquidation zone
- Confirm with 4-hour Heikin-Ashi candles showing exhaustion patterns (small bodies after strong moves, doji patterns, or candle color changes)
- Enter reversal trade when both conditions align

3. Exit Rules:
- Take profit at predetermined risk-reward ratio (suggested 1:2 or better)
- Exit if Heikin-Ashi candles resume trend direction (opposite of reversal expectation)
- Consider partial profits at key support/resistance levels

4. Risk Management:
- Stop-loss placed beyond the extreme of the liquidation cluster zone
- Position size calculated based on stop distance and risk per trade (typically 1-2% of capital)
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events that may cause abnormal liquidity conditions

5. Required Indicators:
- Heikin-Ashi candles (4-hour timeframe)
- Liquidation cluster data (from futures market analysis tools)
- Basic support/resistance levels for profit targets

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets that are showing signs of exhaustion
- More effective when liquidation cluster aligns with key Fibonacci levels or psychological price levels
- Requires patience to wait for proper confirmation
- May produce false signals in strongly trending markets without proper exhaustion
