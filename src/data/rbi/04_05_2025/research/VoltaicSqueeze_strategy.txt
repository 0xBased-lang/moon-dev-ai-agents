STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on volatility contraction/expansion patterns
- Combines Bollinger Bands (standard 20,2 settings) with ATR (14 period)
- Targets explosive breakout moves after periods of low volatility
- Uses 30-day lookback period to identify significant squeeze conditions

2. Entry Rules:

- Confirmation: Price must close above the upper Bollinger Band
- Entry: Next candle open after confirmation close

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit Target: 2x the current 14-period ATR value from entry price
- Stop Loss: No fixed stop - exit only occurs at target
- Alternative Exit: If price closes back inside Bollinger Bands before target hit

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR target distance
- Recommended risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
- No pyramiding allowed - single position only
- Daily timeframe recommended for reduced noise

5. Required Indicators:
