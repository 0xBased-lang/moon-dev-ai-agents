STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme volatility contraction by combining Bollinger Band compression with volume confirmation, then riding the subsequent expansion with ATR-based exits.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (20,2) measuring volatility contraction
2. Klinger Volume Oscillator (34,55,13) for volume confirmation
3. 20-period SMA of Klinger Oscillator as confirmation filter
4. 2x ATR (14) for dynamic profit-taking/stop-loss

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width reaches its lowest point in 6 months (126 trading days)
2. Confirmation: Klinger Volume Oscillator crosses above its 20-period SMA
3. Entry: Next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 2x ATR (14) above entry price (long) or below entry price (short)
2. Stop Loss: 2x ATR (14) in opposite direction
3. Alternative Exit: New 6-month low in BB width while in trade

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk of capital at 2x ATR stop distance
2. Maximum 3 concurrent positions across different instruments
3. Daily time frame recommended for reduced noise
4. Avoid trading during major economic events that may distort volatility

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation
2. Klinger Volume Oscillator (34,55,13)
3. 20-period SMA of Klinger Oscillator
4. ATR (14)
5. 6-month historical comparison for BB width

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different ATR multiples (1.5x-3x) for exits
2. Experiment with BB period (14-26) and width threshold
3. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., >30 for longs, <70 for shorts)
4. Backtest across different asset classes as volatility characteristics vary

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, with reduced effectiveness during sustained high-volatility periods. The unique combination of volatility measurement with volume confirmation provides higher-probability entries into emerging trends.
