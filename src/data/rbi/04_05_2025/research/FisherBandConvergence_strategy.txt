STRATEGY_NAME: FisherBand Convergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three specialized technical indicators to identify high-probability convergence points in market conditions. The core approach uses the Fisher Transform for trend detection, Chaikin Money Flow for volume confirmation, and Bollinger Band Width for volatility filtering.

Key Components:
1. Fisher Transform Indicator - Detects potential trend reversals when crossing zero line
2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) - Confirms buying pressure when >0.1
3. Bollinger Band Width (30-day) - Identifies periods of contraction preceding potential expansion

Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: Fisher Transform crosses ABOVE zero line
- Confirmation 1: Chaikin Money Flow >0.1 (indicating strong buying pressure)
- Confirmation 2: 30-day Bollinger Band Width at narrowest point (indicating low volatility before potential breakout)

Exit Rules:
- Fisher Transform crosses BELOW zero line (signaling potential trend reversal)
- No CMF or BB Width conditions required for exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Recommended 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop Loss: Consider placing below recent swing low or using ATR-based stop
3. Time Filter: Avoid entering trades during major economic news events
4. Volatility Check: Ensure Bollinger Bands aren't excessively wide when entering

Required Indicators:
1. Fisher Transform (standard settings)
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20-period standard)
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard with Width calculation)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different CMF thresholds (0.05-0.15 range)
- Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (20-50 days)
- Consider adding time-based exit (e.g., 5-10 bars after entry)

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals during ranging conditions. The combination of price transformation (Fisher), volume confirmation (CMF), and volatility measurement (BB Width) creates a robust filter for high-quality entries.
