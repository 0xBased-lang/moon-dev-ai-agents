STRATEGY_NAME: FlowVolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend strength analysis with exchange netflow divergence to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during low liquidity periods, using dynamic volatility-based exits.

Key Components:
1. ADX (Average Directional Index) - Measures trend strength (use 14-period)
2. Exchange Netflow Divergence - Compares price action with exchange inflows/outflows
3. Chande Volatility Trailing Stop - Dynamic exit mechanism (default 22-period, 3x multiplier)
4. Liquidity Analysis - Focuses on low-volume trading periods

Entry Rules:
1. Trend Confirmation:
   - ADX > 25 indicates strong trend
   - Price must be above 200EMA for longs, below for shorts

2. Netflow Divergence:
   - Bullish: Price makes lower low while netflow makes higher low
   - Bearish: Price makes higher high while netflow makes lower high

3. Breakout Timing:
   - Enter when price breaks recent swing high/low (last 3-5 candles)
   - Only trade during identified low liquidity periods (typically overnight or lunch hours)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit:
   - Chande Volatility Trailing Stop (22,3)
   - Adjusts stop based on recent volatility

2. Secondary Exit:
   - ADX reversal (when ADX turns down after peak)
   - Netflow reversal (when flows contradict position direction)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - 1-2% risk per trade
   - Adjust position size based on Chande volatility reading

2. Stop Placement:
   - Initial stop: 1.5x recent average true range
   - Never move stop further away

3. Trade Filter:
   - Only take trades where netflow divergence is >2 standard deviations from mean
   - Minimum ADX reading of 25 required

Required Indicators:
1. ADX (14 period)
2. Exchange Netflow Data (preferably with 20-period MA)
3. Chande Volatility Trailing Stop (22,3)
4. Volume Profile (for liquidity analysis)
5. 200 EMA (trend filter)

Special Considerations:
- Works best on 4H and daily timeframes
- Most effective on major crypto pairs (BTC, ETH)
- Requires clean netflow data from reliable exchange APIs
- Backtest across different liquidity regimes before live trading

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust ADX threshold based on asset volatility
- Test different Chande parameters (18-26 periods)
- Combine with seasonal liquidity patterns for better timing
