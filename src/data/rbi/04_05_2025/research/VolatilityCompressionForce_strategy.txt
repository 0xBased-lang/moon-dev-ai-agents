STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityCompressionForce

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Elder Force Index momentum signals with Bollinger Band volatility compression for high-probability entries, using band touches as dynamic exits.

Key Components:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period) - Primary momentum indicator
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Volatility measurement and exit trigger
3. Bollinger Band Width - Volatility compression filter (1-year 20th percentile)
4. 48-hour timeout - Secondary exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Bollinger Band Width must be below its 1-year 20th percentile (compressed volatility)
   - Elder Force Index (13-period) crosses above zero line
   - Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit:
   - Price touches the upper Bollinger Band (take profit)
   - Price touches the lower Bollinger Band (stop loss)
2. Secondary Exit:
   - 48-hour timeout from entry (whichever comes first)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility:
   - Use ATR (14) to determine position size
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Natural stop at lower band provides volatility-adjusted protection
3. Time-based exit prevents excessive capital tie-up

Required Indicators:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period default)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard settings)
3. Bollinger Band Width (20-period)
4. Historical percentile calculation for Band Width
5. Optional: ATR (14) for position sizing

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different percentile thresholds (15-25) for volatility compression
2. Experiment with Force Index periods (10-15)
3. Consider adjusting timeout period based on asset volatility
4. Backtest band touch sensitivity (closing price vs. intraday touch)

This strategy excels in ranging markets after volatility contractions, using the Force Index to confirm emerging momentum while the volatility filter reduces false breakouts. The opposing band touch exit creates a favorable risk-reward ratio by allowing winners to run while quickly cutting losers.
