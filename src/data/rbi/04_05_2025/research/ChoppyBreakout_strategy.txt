STRATEGY_NAME: ChoppyBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Choppiness Index (CI) Filter:** Identifies low-choppiness (trending) conditions when CI < 35.  
2. **Donchian Channel Breakout:** Confirms bullish momentum when price closes above the 20-day upper Donchian Channel.  
3. **ATR-Based Trailing Stop:** Exits trades with a dynamic 5% trailing stop based on Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits and limit losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Choppiness Index (CI) drops below 35 (indicating reduced market noise).  
- **Condition 2:** Price closes above the 20-day Donchian Channel upper band (breakout confirmation).  
- **Action:** Enter long on the next candle’s open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Set a 5% trailing stop based on ATR (e.g., if ATR is $2, trail stop at 5% × $2 = $0.10 below the highest high since entry).  
- **Optional Time Exit:** Close trade after X days if trailing stop isn’t hit (user-defined).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed % of capital per trade (e.g., 1–2%).  
- **Stop Placement:** Initial stop can be set below the Donchian Channel lower band or recent swing low for added safety.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Choppiness Index (CI):** 14-period default (adjustable).  
2. **Donchian Channel:** 20-day period (upper/lower bands).  
3. **Average True Range (ATR):** 14-period for trailing stop calculation.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction (CI) with breakout momentum (Donchian) and adaptive risk control (ATR stop), ideal for trending markets with low false breakouts.
