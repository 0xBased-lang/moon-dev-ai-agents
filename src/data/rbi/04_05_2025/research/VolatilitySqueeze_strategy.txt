STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Entry:** The strategy focuses on low-volatility conditions (measured by ATR) followed by a breakout, indicating potential expansion in volatility.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Confirmation:** Uses Bollinger Bands to identify periods of contraction (squeeze) and subsequent breakout.  
3. **ATR Filter:** The 5-minute ATR must drop below its 20-period moving average to confirm low volatility before entry.  
4. **Breakout Trigger:** Entry occurs when price breaks above the Bollinger Band squeeze threshold (typically the upper band).  
5. **Risk-Managed Exits:** Uses a 2x ATR trailing stop-loss and a reversal below the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) for exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The 5-minute ATR (14-period) must be below its 20-period moving average (indicating low volatility).  
- **Condition 2:** Price must break above the upper Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 standard deviations) after a squeeze (narrowing bands).  
- **Action:** Enter a long position on the breakout candle close.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Set a trailing stop-loss at 2x the current ATR value from the entry price.  
2. **Take-Profit/Reversal Exit:** Exit the trade if price closes below the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop-loss to align with risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause erratic volatility.  
- Only trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend for additional confirmation (optional filter).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR)** – 14-period for volatility measurement.  
2. **ATR Moving Average** – 20-period SMA of ATR to confirm low volatility.  
3. **Bollinger Bands** – 20-period, 2 standard deviations to identify squeeze and breakout levels.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or consolidating markets where volatility compression precedes directional moves.  
- Avoid using in strongly trending markets without pullbacks, as false breakouts may occur.  
- Can be applied to forex, stocks, or crypto on 5-minute or higher timeframes.  

This strategy capitalizes on the "calm before the storm" principle, entering when volatility is suppressed and exiting when momentum fades or reverses.
