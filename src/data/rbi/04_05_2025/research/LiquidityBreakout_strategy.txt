STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility where the market is consolidating, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Order Book Liquidity Clusters:** Focuses on areas in the order book where significant buy/sell orders are clustered, indicating strong support/resistance zones.  
3. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** Ensures the breakout is validated by a sudden increase in trading volume, reducing false signals.  
4. **Predefined Liquidation Levels:** Uses fixed exit points to lock in profits or cut losses systematically.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for Bollinger Band Width to contract below a predefined threshold (e.g., 20-period moving average of the width).  
2. Identify a liquidity cluster in the order book near the current price, acting as a potential breakout level.  
3. Enter a long position if price breaks above the cluster with a surge in volume (e.g., volume > 1.5x the 20-period average).  
4. Enter a short position if price breaks below the cluster with a surge in volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:** Set a predefined profit target (e.g., 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the last 14 periods).  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss at the opposite side of the liquidity cluster (e.g., below the cluster for long trades, above for short trades).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Limit position size to 1-2% of total capital per trade.  
2. Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., overnight or weekends).  
3. Monitor order book dynamics in real-time to adjust exits if liquidity shifts unexpectedly.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) + Band Width calculation.  
2. Volume indicator (e.g., 20-period moving average of volume).  
3. Order book depth data (to identify liquidity clusters).  
4. Average True Range (ATR) for setting profit targets.  

This strategy combines volatility contraction, order book analysis, and volume confirmation for high-probability breakout trades with disciplined risk management.
