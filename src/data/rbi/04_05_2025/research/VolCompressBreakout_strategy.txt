STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy specializes in identifying and capitalizing on volatility compression patterns through a precise combination of Bollinger Band metrics and volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses Bollinger Band width (BBW) as primary volatility indicator
2. Compression Threshold: 10-period BBW must cross below 50% of its 20-day range
3. Volume Confirmation: Requires 3x average volume spike for entry validation
4. Exit Signal: BBW expansion above 75% of its range triggers exit

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for BBW(10) to cross below the 50% level of its 20-day range
2. Confirm with volume spike â‰¥ 3x the 20-day average volume
3. Enter long position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When BBW(10) expands above 75% of its 20-day range
2. Optional Stop Loss: Consider 2x ATR(14) below entry if using protective stop

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Volatility-adjusted stops recommended (e.g., 2x ATR)
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Consider scaling out positions in halves at different BBW expansion levels

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for price context
2. Bollinger Band Width (10-period)
3. 20-day BBW range calculation
4. Volume indicator with 20-day average
5. Optional: ATR(14) for stop placement

Unique Aspects:
- Focuses specifically on volatility compression rather than price levels
- Uses dynamic percentage thresholds based on recent BBW range
- Requires volume confirmation to filter false breakouts
- Self-adjusting exit threshold based on current volatility regime

Optimization Notes:
- Test different BBW period lengths (8-12)
- Experiment with volume multiplier (2.5x-4x)
- Adjust percentage thresholds based on asset volatility
- Consider adding RSI filter for overbought/oversold conditions
