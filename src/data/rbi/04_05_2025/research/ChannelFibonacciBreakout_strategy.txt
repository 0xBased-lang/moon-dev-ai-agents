STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelFibonacciBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to create a hybrid volatility channel
- Uses volume confirmation to validate breakout signals
- Incorporates Fibonacci retracement levels from recent swing points as profit targets
- Focuses on breakouts from established trading ranges

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry: When price closes ABOVE the upper combined Bollinger-Keltner band AND volume is above 20-period average
- Short Entry: When price closes BELOW the lower combined Bollinger-Keltner band AND volume is above 20-period average
- Recent swing points (high/low) must be established within the last 20 bars

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Profit Target: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from recent swing high to swing low (for longs) or swing low to swing high (for shorts)
- Secondary Profit Target: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level
- Stop Loss: Opposite side of the breakout channel band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on distance between entry and stop loss
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of account
- Trailing stop can be implemented after price reaches 38.2% target
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
- Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier)
- Volume indicator (20-period average)
- Fibonacci retracement tool
- Recent swing point identification (20-bar lookback)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- More reliable in trending market conditions
- Requires clear recent swing points for Fibonacci levels
- Volume confirmation helps filter false breakouts
- Combine with overall market trend for higher probability trades
