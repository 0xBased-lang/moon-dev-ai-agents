STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Utilizes cumulative liquidation heatmaps to identify high-probability reversal zones
- Incorporates on-chain exchange flow data for confirmation
- Focuses on counter-trend entries at key liquidity clusters
- Combines price action with blockchain data signals

2. Entry Rules:
- Identify significant liquidation clusters on heatmap (areas with high historical liquidations)
- Wait for price to revisit these levels
- Confirm with diverging exchange flows (e.g., price approaching liquidation zone while exchange outflows increase)
- Require supporting technical factors (e.g., oversold RSI, bullish candlestick patterns)

3. Exit Rules:
- Take profit at next significant liquidity zone (opposite side liquidation cluster)
- Stop loss placed beyond the liquidation zone (typically 1.5-2x average zone width)
- Exit on exchange flow reversal (sudden inflows after position established)
- Time-based exit if expected move doesn't materialize within 3-5 candles

4. Risk Management:
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
- No trades during high-impact news events
- Requires minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio
- Adjust position size based on liquidation cluster strength

5. Required Indicators:
- Cumulative liquidation heatmap (historical and real-time)
- On-chain exchange flow metrics (net inflows/outflows)
- Volume profile analysis
- Optional: RSI (14 period) for overbought/oversold confirmation
- Price action patterns (pin bars, engulfing candles)

6. Special Considerations:
- Works best in ranging or mean-reverting markets
- Less effective during strong trending conditions
- Requires real-time data feeds for liquidation heatmaps
- Most effective on higher timeframes (4H+)
- Should be combined with volatility filters to avoid whipsaws

Note: This strategy requires access to specialized liquidation data and on-chain analytics platforms. Backtesting should account for slippage when entering near liquidation zones where price movement can be volatile.
