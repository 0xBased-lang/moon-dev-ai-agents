STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI) Crossover:** The strategy uses the VI+ (positive trend movement) and VI- (negative trend movement) lines. A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-, indicating potential upward momentum.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Divergence:** Confirms the trend strength by ensuring OBV is rising alongside price, validating accumulation.  
3. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies low volatility periods where a breakout is likely. The squeeze is confirmed when the bands contract significantly.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a **long position** when:  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish momentum).  
  2. OBV is rising (confirms buying pressure).  
  3. Bollinger Bands are in a squeeze (narrowing bands, indicating low volatility before a breakout).  
- Enter a **short position** (if strategy allows) when:  
  1. VI+ crosses below VI- (bearish momentum).  
  2. OBV is falling (confirms selling pressure).  
  3. Bollinger Bands are in a squeeze.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **For long positions:**  
  - Exit when VI+ crosses back below VI- (momentum reversal).  
  - Use a **trailing stop** (e.g., ATR-based or percentage-based) to lock in profits.  
- **For short positions:**  
  - Exit when VI+ crosses back above VI-.  
  - Apply the same trailing stop logic.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-adjusted).  
- Stop-loss placed below recent swing low (long) or above swing high (short).  
- Avoid trading during high volatility outside Bollinger Band squeezes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)** – Tracks trend direction.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)** – Confirms volume-backed momentum.  
3. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – Identifies squeeze conditions.  
4. **Optional:** ATR (14-period) for dynamic stop-loss adjustments.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend confirmation (VI), volume validation (OBV), and low-volatility breakout setups (Bollinger Squeeze) for high-probability entries.
