STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three powerful technical elements - the Vortex Indicator for trend confirmation, volume surge for momentum validation, and Fibonacci levels for precision profit-taking.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) - Uses VI+ and VI- lines to identify trend direction
2. Volume Analysis - Requires 50%+ increase from average volume
3. Fibonacci Retracement - Sets dynamic profit targets at key levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish signal)
   - Current volume exceeds 50-day average by 50%+
   - Price breaks above recent resistance level

2. Short Entry:
   - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish signal)
   - Current volume exceeds 50-day average by 50%+
   - Price breaks below recent support level

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - First target: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of recent swing
   - Second target: 50% retracement level
   - Final target: 61.8% retracement level
   (Scale out positions at each level)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place below recent swing low (for longs) or above swing high (for shorts)
   - Alternative: 1.5x ATR (14-period) from entry point

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Risk-reward ratio minimum 1:2
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Daily loss limit of 5% of total capital

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (default 14-period)
2. Volume (50-day average comparison)
3. Fibonacci Retracement tool
4. Optional: ATR (14-period) for stop placement

Optimization Tips:
1. Test different volume threshold percentages (40-60%)
2. Experiment with Fibonacci extensions beyond 61.8% for stronger trends
3. Consider adding a volatility filter (e.g., only trade when ATR > recent average)

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear breakouts, using volume confirmation to filter false signals and Fibonacci levels for disciplined profit-taking. The Vortex Indicator provides reliable trend direction while the volume surge confirms strong participation in the move.
