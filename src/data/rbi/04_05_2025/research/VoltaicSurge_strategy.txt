STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses Bollinger Band width narrowing below a historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile) to identify periods of low volatility.  
2. **Momentum Confirmation:** Requires ADX to surge above 25 to confirm potential breakout strength.  
3. **Breakout Entry:** Enters on price breakout confirmation (e.g., closing above the upper Bollinger Band for long, below the lower for short).  
4. **Exit Signal:** Exits when ADX flattens or declines, indicating weakening momentum.  
5. **Risk Management:** Uses ATR-based trailing stops to lock in profits and limit losses dynamically.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width narrows below historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile over 100 periods).  
  2. ADX rises above 25 (confirming trend strength).  
  3. Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band (breakout confirmation).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width narrows below historical percentile.  
  2. ADX rises above 25.  
  3. Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** ADX flattens or begins to decline (e.g., 2-period decline from peak).  
- **Secondary Exit:** ATR trailing stop is triggered (e.g., 2x ATR from the highest/lowest point since entry).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Initial stop-loss: 1.5x ATR from entry price.  
- Trailing stop: Adjusts stop to 1x ATR below/above the highest/lowest price reached after entry.  
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** To measure volatility contraction (width) and breakout levels.  
2. **ADX (14):** To confirm trend strength.  
3. **ATR (14):** For dynamic stop placement and risk calculation.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (Bollinger Band width) with momentum surge (ADX) for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses ATR trailing stops to adapt to market conditions, preserving gains during strong trends.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring ADX confirmation.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different historical percentiles for Bollinger Band width (e.g., 10th-30th).  
- Adjust ADX threshold (e.g., 20-30) based on asset volatility.  
- Fine-tune ATR multiplier for stops (e.g., 1.5x-2.5x) to balance risk/reward.  

This strategy excels in trending markets after periods of low volatility, capturing explosive moves while minimizing whipsaw risk.
