STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFlip  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Entry:** The strategy focuses on trading long volatility when the 4-hour Chaikin Volatility indicator crosses above its 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). This signals an expansion in volatility, often preceding significant price movements.  
2. **Funding Rate Confirmation:** The trade is only taken if funding rates flip negative, indicating potential bearish sentiment or short-term overextension in the market. This acts as a secondary confirmation filter.  
3. **Exit at Bollinger Band Extremes:** Positions are closed when price reaches the upper or lower Bollinger Band extremes, suggesting overbought or oversold conditions and potential mean reversion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Volatility Trigger:** Chaikin Volatility (4H) crosses above its 20-period SMA.  
- **Confirmation:** Funding rates must be negative (indicating bearish sentiment or short-term pressure).  
- **Trade Direction:** The strategy is agnostic to directionâ€”it capitalizes on volatility expansion, so trades can be long or short depending on the prevailing trend or breakout context.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Bollinger Band Extremes:** Exit the trade when price touches either the upper or lower Bollinger Band (typically set to 2 standard deviations).  
- **Optional Time-Based Exit:** Consider closing the trade if volatility contracts (Chaikin Volatility crosses back below its 20 SMA) before hitting Bollinger Bands.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the swing high (for short trades) to limit downside.  
- **Position Sizing:** Use volatility-adjusted position sizing (e.g., ATR-based) to account for changing market conditions.  
- **Avoid Overleveraging:** Since the strategy trades volatility spikes, excessive leverage can lead to large drawdowns.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Chaikin Volatility:** Measures the difference between high and low prices over a period, normalized by the average price range.  
2. **20-Period SMA of Chaikin Volatility:** Smooths the volatility readings to identify crossovers.  
3. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Identifies overbought/oversold levels for exits.  
4. **Funding Rates (from exchange data):** Confirms bearish sentiment for trade validation.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending or breakout markets where volatility expansion leads to sustained moves.  
- Less effective in low-volatility, range-bound conditions.  
- Ideal for crypto markets due to the sensitivity to funding rates and volatility regimes.  

This strategy combines volatility expansion signals with sentiment analysis (funding rates) and mean-reversion exits (Bollinger Bands) for a systematic approach to trading volatility spikes.
