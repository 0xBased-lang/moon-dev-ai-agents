STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Confirmation:** The strategy uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) to confirm a bullish trend.  
2. **Volume Filter:** Only trades during high-volume sessions, ensuring stronger momentum behind the breakout.  
3. **Breakout Entry:** Enters trades when price breaks out above a recent high or resistance level, validated by the EMA crossover and high volume.  
4. **ATR-Based Exits:** Uses a 2x ATR stop-loss for initial risk management and a 1.5x ATR trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves favorably.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross).  
2. Confirm that the breakout occurs during a high-volume session (volume significantly above the average).  
3. Enter long on a breakout above a recent high or resistance level.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Initial Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss at 2x ATR below the entry price.  
2. **Trailing Stop:** Adjust the stop-loss to 1.5x ATR below the highest price reached since entry (trailing mechanism).  
3. Exit the trade if the trailing stop is triggered or if the 50-period EMA crosses back below the 200-period EMA (trend reversal signal).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing should be calculated based on the 2x ATR stop-loss to ensure risk per trade aligns with your risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
2. Avoid trading during low-volume periods to reduce false breakouts.  
3. Only trade in the direction of the confirmed trend (EMA crossover).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
3. Average True Range (ATR) for stop-loss and trailing stop calculations.  
4. Volume indicator to confirm high-volume sessions.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.  
- Backtest the strategy with different ATR multiples (e.g., 1.5x stop-loss, 1x trailing) to optimize for your preferred risk-reward ratio.  
- Combine with additional confirmation (e.g., candlestick patterns, RSI divergence) for higher-probability setups.
