STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Liquidation Cluster Levels: Derived from aggregated futures data to identify significant price levels where liquidations may occur
- Volatility Filter: Uses Bollinger Bandwidth contraction to identify low-volatility conditions (10-day low)
- Breakout Entry: Triggers trades when price crosses liquidation cluster levels during favorable volatility conditions

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: Bollinger Bandwidth reaches 10-day low (volatility contraction signal)
- Secondary Condition: Price crosses a pre-identified liquidation cluster level
- Entry Type: Breakout entry in direction of the cluster level crossing (long if above, short if below)

3. Exit Rules:
- Fixed Risk-Reward: Suggested 1:2 ratio (adjustable based on trader preference)
- Volatility Expansion Exit: Consider exiting when Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond 2x the entry level
- Cluster Flip Exit: If price crosses opposite liquidation cluster level

4. Risk Management:
- Position Sizing: Based on distance to opposite cluster level or fixed percentage of capital
- Stop Loss: Place below (for longs) or above (for shorts) the traded cluster level
- Maximum Risk: Suggested 1-2% of capital per trade

5. Required Indicators:
- Liquidation Cluster Indicator (derived from futures data)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation settings recommended)
- Bollinger Bandwidth (calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending market conditions following volatility contractions
- Requires clean identification of liquidation cluster levels (may need specialized data feed)
- Suggested timeframe: 4-hour or daily charts for swing trading
- Backtest recommended to optimize bandwidth threshold and cluster sensitivity

This strategy combines order flow analysis (via liquidation clusters) with volatility regime filtering for high-probability breakout trades. The unique combination of these elements justifies the "LiquidationBandwidth" name.
