STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBackwardation  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Entry:** The strategy focuses on low volatility conditions, using the 20-day Average True Range (ATR) to identify periods of compressed volatility.  
2. **VIX Backwardation Filter:** The strategy requires the VIX term structure to be in backwardation (front-month VIX higher than subsequent months), indicating heightened short-term volatility expectations.  
3. **Mean-Reversion Bias:** By entering when ATR is extremely low (below its 10th percentile), the strategy anticipates a reversion to higher volatility and potential upward price movement.  
4. **ATR-Based Exit:** Positions are closed when price moves 2x the current ATR from the entry point, locking in profits during volatility expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The 20-day ATR must drop below its 10th percentile (calculated over a rolling 252-day lookback period).  
- **Condition 2:** The VIX term structure must be in backwardation (VIX front-month > VIX second-month).  
- **Action:** Enter a long position when both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking:** Exit the long position if the price moves 2x the current ATR value (at entry) above the entry price.  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** Consider adding a 1x ATR trailing stop below the entry price for additional risk management.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Use ATR-based position sizing to ensure consistent risk per trade (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade based on 1x ATR stop).  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading during high-volatility regimes (e.g., when ATR is above its 50th percentile).  
- **VIX Confirmation:** The backwardation requirement reduces false signals by ensuring short-term volatility expectations align with the trade thesis.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR):** 20-day ATR for volatility measurement and exit criteria.  
2. **VIX Term Structure:** To confirm backwardation (front-month VIX > second-month VIX).  
3. **ATR Percentile:** Rolling 252-day lookback to identify the 10th percentile threshold.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility compression (ATR percentile) with VIX term structure for high-probability entries.  
- Uses ATR dynamically for both entry filtering and profit-taking, creating a self-adjusting exit mechanism.  
- Ideal for mean-reversion strategies in equity indices or ETFs during low-volatility regimes.  

**Note:** Backtest this strategy across multiple asset classes to confirm robustness, as VIX backwardation may behave differently in non-equity markets.
