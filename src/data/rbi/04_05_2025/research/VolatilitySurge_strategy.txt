STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Breakout System**: The strategy capitalizes on significant price movements by using ATR-based bands around an EMA.  
2. **Entry Trigger**: Trades are initiated when price crosses a 2x ATR band derived from a 20-period EMA.  
3. **Exit Mechanism**: Positions are closed when price retraces 50% of the initial breakout move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when price closes above the upper band (20 EMA + 2x ATR).  
- **Short Entry**: Triggered when price closes below the lower band (20 EMA - 2x ATR).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: Close the position when price retraces 50% from the highest point reached after the breakout.  
- **Short Exit**: Close the position when price retraces 50% from the lowest point reached after the breakout.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: Initial stop-loss can be set at the opposite ATR band (e.g., for a long trade, the stop would be at the lower band).  
2. **Position Sizing**: Use ATR-based position sizing to adjust for volatility (e.g., risk a fixed % of capital per trade based on ATR distance).  
3. **Trailing Stop**: Optionally, use a dynamic trailing stop based on a fraction of ATR to lock in profits.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** – Acts as the baseline for the ATR bands.  
2. **Average True Range (ATR, 20-period)** – Used to calculate the volatility bands (2x multiplier).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend-following (EMA) with volatility breakout (ATR bands).  
- Exits are based on retracement rather than static profit targets, allowing for extended moves.  
- Adapts to changing market conditions via dynamic ATR-based bands.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different ATR multipliers (e.g., 1.5x or 2.5x) for varying volatility regimes.  
- Adjust the EMA period (e.g., 15 or 25) for faster/slower trend sensitivity.  
- Consider adding a filter (e.g., RSI or ADX) to avoid false breakouts in ranging markets.  

This strategy excels in trending, volatile markets but may underperform in choppy conditions. Backtesting across multiple asset classes is recommended.
