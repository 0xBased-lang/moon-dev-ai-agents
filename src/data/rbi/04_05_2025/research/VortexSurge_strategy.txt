STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Measures trend direction and strength. A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-.  
2. **Volume Spike Filter:** Requires a 50% increase in volume compared to the 10-day average to confirm the entry signal.  
3. **Keltner Channel Exit:** Uses the upper band of the Keltner Channel as the profit-taking level, providing a dynamic resistance-based exit.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a **long position** when:  
  - The **VI+ line crosses above VI-** (bullish trend confirmation).  
  - Current **volume is at least 50% higher** than the 10-day average volume (confirms strong participation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close the long position when:  
  - Price touches or exceeds the **upper band of the Keltner Channel** (profit-taking level).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss Placement:**  
   - Set below the recent swing low or use a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3% below entry).  
   - Alternatively, exit if **VI- crosses back above VI+**, signaling trend weakness.  
2. **Position Sizing:**  
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)** – For trend confirmation.  
2. **Volume (10-day average comparison)** – For entry validation.  
3. **Keltner Channel (default settings: 20-period EMA, 2x ATR bands)** – For dynamic exit targeting.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in **trending markets**; may produce false signals in choppy conditions.  
- Combine with higher timeframe alignment (e.g., daily chart bias) for improved accuracy.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods (e.g., holidays) to reduce noise.  

This strategy leverages **trend confirmation (Vortex) + volume surge** for high-probability entries and uses **Keltner Channel bands** for disciplined exits.
