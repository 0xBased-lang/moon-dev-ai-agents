STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumCrossfire

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- EMA Crossover System: Uses the 50-period and 200-period EMA crossover (Golden Cross/Death Cross) as primary trend signals
- Momentum Confirmation: Requires ADX (Average Directional Index) to rise above 25 to validate trend strength
- Breakout Execution: Enters trades when price confirms the crossover with a breakout
- Fixed Risk-Reward: Implements strict 2:1 profit-taking while maintaining disciplined stop-losses

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry:
  * 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA (Golden Cross)
  * ADX rises above 25 (and preferably increasing)
  * Price breaks above recent swing high
- Short Entry:
  * 50 EMA crosses below 200 EMA (Death Cross)
  * ADX rises above 25 (and preferably increasing)
  * Price breaks below recent swing low

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit Target: 2x the initial risk (measured from entry to stop-loss)
- Stop-Loss Placement:
  * For longs: Below the most recent swing low
  * For shorts: Above the most recent swing high
- Emergency Exit: Close position if ADX falls below 20, indicating weakening momentum

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- No new entries if ADX is declining (below 25 and falling)
- Avoid trading during choppy market conditions (ADX < 20)
- Maximum 5% portfolio exposure to any single trade

5. Required Indicators:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- ADX (14-period standard setting) with +DI/-DI lines (optional for additional confirmation)
- Price chart with clear swing highs/lows for breakout confirmation

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for daily or 4-hour timeframes
- Works particularly well in trending commodities and forex markets
- Requires patience as EMA crossovers may be infrequent but high-probability
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher timeframe confluence
- Avoid using in ranging markets (watch for ADX below 20)

This MomentumCrossfire strategy combines the reliability of long-term EMA crossovers with momentum confirmation from ADX, creating a high-probability trend-following system with disciplined risk management.
