STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **TTM Squeeze Indicator**: Identifies periods of low volatility (contraction) followed by potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation**: Requires trading volume to spike above the 90th percentile to validate the breakout.  
3. **ATR Trailing Stop**: Uses a 2x ATR (Average True Range) trailing stop to manage risk and lock in profits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when:  
  - The TTM Squeeze indicator exits contraction (releases).  
  - Trading volume surges above the 90th percentile of recent volume (e.g., 20-day lookback).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Opposing Squeeze Signal**: Exit the trade if the TTM Squeeze re-enters contraction or shows a bearish signal.  
- **Trailing Stop**: Exit if price retraces by 2x the current ATR from the highest point since entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).  
- **Stop-Loss**: The 2x ATR trailing stop dynamically adjusts to volatility, protecting gains and limiting losses.  
- **Avoid Low-Volume Breakouts**: Only trade when volume confirms the breakout to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **TTM Squeeze**: To identify contraction/release phases.  
2. **Volume Percentile (90th)**: To confirm high-volume breakouts.  
3. **ATR (14-period)**: For trailing stop placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (Squeeze) with volume confirmation for high-probability entries.  
- Uses a dynamic trailing stop based on ATR to adapt to market conditions.  
- Filters out low-conviction breakouts by requiring extreme volume surges.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different ATR multipliers (e.g., 1.5x-3x) for the trailing stop.  
- Adjust the volume percentile threshold (e.g., 85th-95th) based on asset volatility.  
- Pair with a trend filter (e.g., 50EMA above 200EMA) to avoid counter-trend squeezes.
