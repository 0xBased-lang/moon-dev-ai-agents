STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationClusteredVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on shorting volatility during high liquidation events
- Uses order book imbalance and funding rate extremes as primary triggers
- Combines Bollinger Band width contraction with volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for timing
- Specifically targets periods of market stress where liquidations cluster

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for confluence of:
  a) Extreme funding rate (top/bottom 5% of historical range)
  b) Order book imbalance showing excessive one-sided liquidity
  c) Bollinger Band width contraction after a volatility spike
- Enter short volatility position when all three conditions align
- Prefer entries when VWAP is extended from mean

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary exit at VWAP reversion to mean
- Secondary exit if Bollinger Band width expands beyond threshold
- Emergency exit if funding rate reverses direction sharply
- Trail stop based on recent volatility (ATR-based)

4. Risk Management:
- Position size based on volatility (use inverse volatility weighting)
- Hard stop at 1.5x average true range (ATR)
- Maximum portfolio allocation of 3% per trade
- Avoid trading during scheduled macroeconomic news events

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20 period, 2 std dev)
- Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)
- Order book depth analyzer (bid/ask imbalance)
- Funding rate monitor (with historical percentiles)
- Average true range (ATR) for risk sizing

6. Unique Aspects:
- Specifically designed for crypto markets with perpetual contracts
- Exploits the "liquidation cascade" market phenomenon
- Combines order flow analysis with technical indicators
- Focuses on the transition from high to low volatility regimes

7. Optimization Tips:
- Backtest across multiple crypto assets with high perpetual volume
- Adjust Bollinger Band parameters based on asset volatility
- Calibrate funding rate thresholds per asset (some have higher natural ranges)
- Test different VWAP lookback periods (14-21 days often works well)
