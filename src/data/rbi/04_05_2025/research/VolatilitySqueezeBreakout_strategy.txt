STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:**  
   - **Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP):** Measures the relative width of Bollinger Bands compared to historical data. A value below 20% indicates extreme contraction, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
   - **Keltner Channel Squeeze:** Confirms volatility contraction when the Keltner Channel width is at multi-period lows, reinforcing the Bollinger Band signal.  

2. **Breakout Confirmation:**  
   - **Volume Surge:** A breakout is validated only if trading volume exceeds the 50-day moving average of volume, ensuring strong participation in the move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup Conditions:**  
   - BBWP < 20% (indicating extreme volatility contraction).  
   - Keltner Channel width at its lowest levels in recent periods (e.g., 20-period low).  
   - Price is consolidating within the Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels.  

2. **Trigger:**  
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or below the lower Bollinger Band.  
   - Volume exceeds the 50-day average volume on the breakout candle.  

3. **Entry Execution:**  
   - **Long Entry:** Buy if price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with high volume.  
   - **Short Entry:** Sell if price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with high volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:**  
   - Use a trailing stop based on the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., for long trades, trail stop below the lower band).  
   - Alternatively, target a multiple of the average true range (ATR) at entry (e.g., 2x ATR).  

2. **Stop Loss:**  
   - Place initial stop loss inside the Bollinger Band/Keltner Channel (e.g., mid-band or opposite band).  
   - For long trades: Stop below the recent swing low or lower Bollinger Band.  
   - For short trades: Stop above the recent swing high or upper Bollinger Band.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:**  
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
   - Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop loss.  

2. **Trade Filter:**  
   - Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods.  
   - Focus on liquid assets with tight spreads to reduce slippage.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).**  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) or custom calculation for width percentile.**  
3. **Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier).**  
4. **Volume (50-day moving average for surge confirmation).**  
5. **Optional:** ATR (14-period) for profit target scaling.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines Bollinger Band and Keltner Channel squeezes for high-probability setups.  
- Volume surge acts as a confirmation filter, reducing false breakouts.  
- Focuses on extreme volatility contractions, which often precede strong directional moves.  

This strategy is ideal for traders looking to capitalize on explosive moves after periods of low volatility, with clear rules for entry, exit, and risk management.
