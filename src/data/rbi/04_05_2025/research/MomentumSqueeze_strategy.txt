STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with volatility contraction to identify high-probability swing trades. The key components are:  

1. **Indicators Used**:  
   - **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)**: Measures momentum strength (default 14-period).  
   - **Bollinger Band Width**: Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band, showing volatility compression when narrowing.  

2. **Entry Rules**:  
   - **Long Entry**: Trigger when:  
     - CMO crosses **above 50** (bullish momentum confirmation).  
     - Bollinger Band Width is **contracting** (recent width < previous width).  
   - **Short Entry**: Trigger when:  
     - CMO crosses **below 50** (bearish momentum confirmation).  
     - Bollinger Band Width is **contracting** (recent width < previous width).  

3. **Exit Rules**:  
   - **Opposite Crossover**: Close long if CMO drops below 50; close short if CMO rises above 50.  
   - **Trailing Stop**: 3% trailing stop from the highest close (long) or lowest close (short) after entry.  

4. **Risk Management**:  
   - Position sizing should limit risk to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
   - Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false volatility signals.  

5. **Filters (Optional)**:  
   - Add a 200-period moving average to confirm the broader trend direction.  
   - Require Bollinger Band Width to be below its 20-period average to confirm contraction.  

**Why It Works**: The CMO crossover validates momentum, while narrowing Bollinger Bands signal a potential breakout. The trailing stop locks in profits during volatile moves.  

**Note**: Backtest to optimize CMO period (e.g., 9 vs. 14) and Bollinger Band settings (e.g., 20,2 vs. 50,2.5) for your asset class.

This strategy excels in ranging or mildly trending markets but may underperform in strong, sustained trends without additional filters.
