STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width reaches a 20-day low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Spike Confirmation:** A 150% increase in volume relative to the 10-day average confirms strong participation in the breakout move.  
3. **Breakout Execution:** Entries are triggered when price breaks out of the contracted Bollinger Bands with the volume spike.  
4. **Exit Conditions:** Positions are closed either when price touches the opposite Bollinger Band (mean reversion signal) or after holding for 5 periods (time-based exit).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Wait for Bollinger Band width (BB Width) to reach a 20-day low, indicating contraction.  
- Confirm a volume spike of at least 150% above the 10-day average volume.  
- Enter long on a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band or short on a breakout below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Opposite Band Touch:** Close the trade if price touches the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., exit long if price hits the lower band).  
- **Time-Based Exit:** Automatically exit after 5 periods (bars) if the opposite band isnâ€™t touched.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a stop-loss just beyond the breakout band (e.g., for a long entry, place a stop below the lower band).  
- Position sizing should account for the volatility contraction (e.g., wider stops may require smaller position sizes).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations).  
2. **Bollinger Band Width** (BB Width = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  
3. **Volume** (10-day average volume for comparison).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (BB Width) with volume confirmation for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses both price action (band touch) and time-based exits to balance trend-following and mean reversion.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring volume spikes.  

**Note:** This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation phases. Backtest for optimal parameters (e.g., BB period, volume spike threshold).
