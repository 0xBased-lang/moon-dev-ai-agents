STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySpike  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Breakout Trigger:** The strategy identifies breakout opportunities when the 5-minute Average True Range (ATR) exceeds the daily ATR by 150%. This indicates a significant increase in short-term volatility compared to the typical daily range.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** A volume spike above the 20-period moving average of volume is required to confirm the breakout, ensuring the move is supported by trading activity.  
3. **Trailing Stop Exit:** Positions are managed with a dynamic trailing stop set at 2x the entry ATR, allowing profits to run while protecting against reversals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  - The 5-minute ATR > (Daily ATR * 1.5)  
  - Current volume > 20-period moving average of volume  
- Entry is executed at the next candle's open after conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit the position when price closes below (highest high since entry - 2x entry ATR).  
- Optional: Add a time-based exit (e.g., end of trading session) if the strategy is intraday-only.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be based on the entry ATR (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade, with stop distance = 2x ATR).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., overnight or major news events) to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR):**  
   - 5-minute ATR (short-term volatility)  
   - Daily ATR (baseline volatility)  
2. **Volume:**  
   - 20-period moving average of volume (confirmation filter)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility expansion (ATR ratio) with volume confirmation for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses a dynamic trailing stop tied to entry volatility, adapting to market conditions.  
- Avoids static profit targets, letting trends unfold while protecting gains.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different ATR multiples (e.g., 125%, 175%) to adjust sensitivity.  
- Consider adding a minimum daily ATR threshold to filter low-volatility days.  
- Volume spike threshold can be adjusted (e.g., 1.5x average) for stricter confirmation.
