STRATEGY_NAME: DualMomentumFisher

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum confirmation through Heiken-Ashi smoothed trends with Fisher Transform signal crossovers, while dynamically adjusting risk exposure using volatility measurements.

Key Components:
1. Heiken-Ashi Candles - Smoothed price action to identify trend direction
2. Fisher Transform - Momentum oscillator that helps identify potential reversals
3. Chande's Volatility Index (CVI) - Measures market volatility for stop placement
4. Trailing Stop Mechanism - Dynamic exit system based on volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Heiken-Ashi candles must show consistent color (green for uptrend/red for downtrend) for 3 consecutive periods
2. Secondary Condition: Fisher Transform must cross above/below its signal line in the direction of the Heiken-Ashi trend
3. Confirmation: Price must be above/below the 20-period EMA for long/short entries respectively

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: Initial stop placed at 2x CVI value from entry price, trailing at 1.5x CVI
2. Fisher Transform Reversal: Exit when Fisher crosses signal line opposite to trade direction
3. Heiken-Ashi Reversal: Exit when Heiken-Ashi candles change color for 2 consecutive periods

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade using CVI-adjusted stops
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 3% of account
3. No new entries if CVI exceeds threshold (suggested 40-50 range)
4. Time-based exit if trade doesn't reach 1:1.5 RR within 48 hours

Required Indicators:
1. Heiken-Ashi Candles (smoothed price representation)
2. Fisher Transform (14-period default)
3. Chande's Volatility Index (9-period recommended)
4. 20-period Exponential Moving Average (trend filter)

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust Fisher Transform period (10-20) based on asset volatility
2. Test CVI multiplier (1.5-2.5x) for stop placement
3. Consider adding volume filter for higher timeframe confirmation
4. Backtest optimal Heiken-Ashi confirmation period (2-5 candles)

This DualMomentumFisher strategy provides a systematic approach to momentum trading with built-in volatility adaptation, suitable for trending markets across various timeframes.
