STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeAccumulation

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume accumulation signals to identify high-probability volatility breakout opportunities. The approach waits for extreme compression in volatility before entering trades confirmed by underlying accumulation patterns.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction: Measures the relative width between Bollinger Bands (typically (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band)
2. Klinger Volume Oscillator (KVO): A sophisticated volume indicator that combines price, volume and trend
3. Time-based Exit: Secondary exit condition to prevent overstaying trades

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Bandwidth must contract below its 10th percentile (measured over lookback period, typically 100-200 days)
2. Confirmation: Klinger Volume Oscillator must show accumulation (positive values above its signal line)
3. Execution: Enter long on breakout above upper Bollinger Band (for long trades) or below lower band (for short trades)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Opposite Bollinger Band (exit long at lower band, exit short at upper band)
2. Secondary Exit: Close position after 3 trading days if not stopped out
3. Optional Trailing Stop: Consider adding ATR-based trailing stop (e.g., 1.5-2x ATR)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop at opposite band or recent swing low/high
3. Volatility Filter: Avoid trading during high volatility regimes (when bandwidth > 50th percentile)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations typical)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth calculation
3. Klinger Volume Oscillator (default 34,55,13 parameters)
4. Percentile calculation for bandwidth (requires historical data storage)

Optimization Considerations:
1. Adjust bandwidth percentile threshold (5th-15% range)
2. Test different Bollinger Band periods (10-30 days)
3. Experiment with KVO parameters
4. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., only trade if RSI <70 for longs, >30 for shorts)

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases, and requires patience as extreme bandwidth contractions may be infrequent but high-probability setups.
