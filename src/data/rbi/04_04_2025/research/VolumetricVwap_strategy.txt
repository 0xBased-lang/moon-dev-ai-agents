STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricVwap

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted average price (VWAP) analysis with volatility-based position management, specifically designed for short-term trading in liquid markets. The core concept revolves around identifying high-probability entries when short-term momentum (5-min VWAP) confirms longer-term direction (1-hr VWAP) during periods of exceptional volume activity.

Key Components:
1. Dual-Timeframe VWAP Analysis:
   - 5-minute VWAP (short-term momentum indicator)
   - 1-hour VWAP (longer-term trend reference)
2. Volume Filter:
   - Relative volume percentile (90th percentile threshold)
3. Volatility-Based Position Management:
   - 2x ATR stop-loss
   - 1.5x ATR take-profit

Entry Rules:
1. Volume must be in the top 10% of recent periods (above 90th percentile)
2. 5-minute VWAP must cross above 1-hour VWAP
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Stop-loss: 2x current ATR (14-period) below entry price
2. Take-profit: 1.5x current ATR (14-period) above entry price
3. Whichever condition triggers first exits the position

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the ATR stop distance
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. No new entries if current position is active
4. Recommended trading hours: High liquidity periods (market open, major session overlaps)

Required Indicators:
1. Two VWAP calculations (5-min and 1-hr timeframes)
2. Volume percentile indicator (90-period lookback)
3. ATR (14-period) for stop and profit calculations

Optimization Notes:
- The 90th percentile volume filter can be adjusted between 85-95% based on market conditions
- ATR multiples can be tested between 1.25-2.5x for both stop and profit
- Works best on liquid assets with consistent volume patterns (major forex pairs, large-cap stocks, popular crypto assets)

This strategy capitalizes on the confluence of three powerful factors: volume confirmation, multi-timeframe alignment, and volatility-adjusted risk management, making it particularly effective during periods of strong directional moves.
