STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Counter-Trend Approach:** The strategy capitalizes on extreme market conditions where clustered liquidations create potential reversal opportunities.  
2. **Order Book Delta Imbalances:** Detects significant liquidity zones where stop-loss orders are likely clustered, indicating potential exhaustion of the current trend.  
3. **RSI Confirmation:** Uses a 4-hour RSI reversal below 20 (oversold) or above 80 (overbought) to validate the counter-trend signal.  
4. **Volume-Weighted Pivot Points:** Exits are based on retracements to key pivot levels weighted by volume, ensuring alignment with significant liquidity areas.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Liquidation Zone Detection:** Identify order book delta imbalances where large clusters of stop orders are likely to trigger (e.g., high negative delta for long liquidations or high positive delta for short liquidations).  
2. **RSI Reversal Confirmation:**  
   - For long entries: Wait for RSI to cross back above 20 after being below it, signaling potential oversold reversal.  
   - For short entries: Wait for RSI to cross back below 80 after being above it, signaling potential overbought reversal.  
3. **Entry Execution:** Enter the trade once both the liquidation zone and RSI reversal criteria are met, with a limit order near the detected imbalance zone for better fill prices.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted Pivot Points:** Calculate pivot points (support/resistance) weighted by recent volume to identify high-probability exit zones.  
2. **Profit-Taking:** Exit the trade when price retraces to the nearest volume-weighted pivot level in the opposite direction of the trend.  
3. **Stop-Loss Placement:** Set a stop-loss just beyond the detected liquidation zone to account for potential continuation of the original trend.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade, adjusting position size based on the distance to the stop-loss level.  
2. **Stop-Loss Discipline:** Strictly adhere to stop-loss levels to prevent large drawdowns during false reversals.  
3. **Avoid Overleveraging:** Use moderate leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) to withstand volatility while maximizing returns.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Order Book Delta:** To detect liquidation zones and imbalances (e.g., cumulative delta or depth-of-market analysis).  
2. **4-Hour RSI (14-period):** For overbought/oversold reversal confirmation.  
3. **Volume-Weighted Pivot Points:** Calculated using recent high, low, close, and volume data to identify exit levels.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines liquidation clustering (a high-probability mean-reversion signal) with RSI reversals for added confirmation.  
- Uses volume-weighted pivots for exits, aligning with natural liquidity areas rather than arbitrary price targets.  
- Focuses on extreme market conditions where forced liquidations often lead to sharp reversals.  

This strategy is best suited for volatile assets (e.g., crypto, forex) where liquidations are frequent and order book data is reliable.
