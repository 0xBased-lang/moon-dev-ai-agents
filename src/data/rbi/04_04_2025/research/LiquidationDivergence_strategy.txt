STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Spike Analysis:** The strategy identifies significant liquidation events (spikes) within a 24-hour window, suggesting potential market exhaustion.  
2. **RSI Divergence:** A bullish RSI divergence (higher lows in RSI while price makes lower lows) confirms weakening bearish momentum.  
3. **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** Rising OBV indicates accumulation and buying pressure, supporting the bullish case.  
4. **Bollinger Bands:** Used for exit targeting, with the upper band acting as a dynamic resistance level.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger:** A 24-hour liquidation spike occurs (indicating forced selling).  
- **Confirmation:**  
  - Bullish RSI divergence forms (RSI shows higher lows while price shows lower lows).  
  - OBV is in an uptrend (higher highs and higher lows).  
- **Entry Point:** Enter long on the next candle close after all conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit at 1.5x the upper Bollinger Band (calculated as: Upper Band + 0.5 * Band Width).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low or a key support level (adjust based on volatility).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for liquidation volatility (e.g., smaller size if spike was extreme).  
- Stop-loss should be tight enough to limit losses but avoid premature exits due to noise.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods where liquidation spikes may be less reliable.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Liquidation Data Feed** (e.g., from exchanges or APIs like Coinalyze).  
2. **RSI (14-period recommended)** for divergence detection.  
3. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)** to confirm buying pressure.  
4. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** for exit targeting.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines liquidation events (a sentiment extreme) with technical confirmations (RSI divergence + OBV).  
- Uses Bollinger Band expansion for dynamic profit-taking rather than fixed targets.  
- Focuses on "smart money" accumulation signals (OBV) after forced liquidations.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different RSI periods (e.g., 10 vs. 14) for divergence sensitivity.  
- Adjust the Bollinger Band multiplier (1.3xâ€“1.7x) based on asset volatility.  
- Filter for high-liquidity assets where liquidation spikes are more meaningful.  

This strategy excels in crypto markets where liquidations heavily impact price action. The name "LiquidationDivergence" reflects its core mechanism: trading reversals after liquidation spikes confirmed by divergence.
