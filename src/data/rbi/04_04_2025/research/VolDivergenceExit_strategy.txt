STRATEGY_NAME: VolDivergenceExit  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Historical Volatility (HV) Analysis:** Uses 10-day HV crossing below its 30-day average to signal potential trend weakness.  
2. **Price Volume Trend (PVT) Divergence:** Requires negative divergence (price making higher highs while PVT makes lower highs) to confirm bearish momentum.  
3. **Exit Conditions:**  
   - **50-day SMA Confluence:** Acts as a dynamic support level for profit-taking or stop-loss adjustment.  
   - **Volatility Spike Reversal:** Monitors sudden increases in volatility (e.g., HV surge) to exit trades early.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short Signal:** Triggered when:  
  1. **10-day HV crosses below 30-day HV average** (indicating declining volatility).  
  2. **Negative PVT divergence** is present (price rising, PVT falling).  
- **Confirmation:** Optional candle close below a recent swing low for added conviction.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target/Stop-Loss:**  
   - **50-day SMA:** Exit if price retraces to touch or approach the 50-day SMA.  
   - **Volatility Reversal:** Exit if 10-day HV spikes above 30-day HV average abruptly.  
2. **Time-Based Exit:** Consider closing after 5-7 days if neither exit condition is met.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk â‰¤1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop-Loss (Optional):** Place above the recent swing high or a volatility-derived ATR multiple (e.g., 2x ATR).  
- **Filter:** Avoid trading during major economic events to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Historical Volatility (10-day and 30-day averages).**  
2. **Price Volume Trend (PVT) for divergence detection.**  
3. **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) for exit confluence.**  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility decay with volume-based divergence, targeting exhaustion points in bearish trends. The 50-day SMA acts as a "smart" exit zone, while volatility spikes protect against sudden reversals.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize HV lookback periods and PVT settings for specific assets (e.g., equities vs. forex).
