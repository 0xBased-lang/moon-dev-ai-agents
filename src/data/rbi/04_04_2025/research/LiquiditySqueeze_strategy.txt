STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiditySqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility (contraction) where price is consolidating, often preceding a breakout.  
2. **Liquidation Heatmap Clusters:** Highlights high liquidity zones where large orders are likely clustered, increasing the probability of strong price movements.  
3. **Keltner Channels:** Used to confirm volatility expansion, signaling potential exits when price breaks out of the contraction phase.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Wait for a Bollinger Band squeeze (bands narrowing significantly, indicating low volatility).  
- Confirm that the price is near a high liquidity zone on the liquidation heatmap (cluster of liquidations suggests potential for a strong move).  
- Enter long if price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band in a high liquidity zone.  
- Enter short if price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band in a high liquidity zone.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Monitor Keltner Channels for volatility expansion (price breaking above/below the Keltner Channel).  
- Exit long trades when price closes below the lower Keltner Channel.  
- Exit short trades when price closes above the upper Keltner Channel.  
- Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on recent swing highs/lows to lock in profits.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss orders just beyond the opposite Bollinger Band to limit downside if the breakout fails.  
- Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., outside major market hours).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. **Liquidation Heatmap** (shows clustered liquidation levels).  
3. **Keltner Channels** (20-period EMA, 1.5 ATR multiplier).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best on higher timeframes (1H, 4H, Daily) where liquidity zones are more reliable.  
- Avoid trading during major news events that can cause false breakouts.  
- Combine with volume analysis to confirm liquidity zone validity.  

This strategy capitalizes on the alignment of volatility contraction (Bollinger Squeeze) and high liquidity zones, increasing the probability of successful breakouts while using Keltner Channels to confirm exits.
