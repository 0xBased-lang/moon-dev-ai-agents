STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **ADX (Average Directional Index)** – Measures trend strength (values above 25 indicate a strong trend).  
2. **Keltner Channel** – A volatility-based envelope that helps identify squeeze conditions (narrowing bands suggest low volatility before potential breakouts).  
3. **Volume Surge** – Confirms breakout validity when volume exceeds the 50-day average.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - ADX > 25 (strong trend confirmation)  
  - Price breaks **above** the upper Keltner Channel  
  - Volume exceeds the 50-day average (confirms breakout strength)  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - ADX > 25 (strong trend confirmation)  
  - Price breaks **below** the lower Keltner Channel  
  - Volume exceeds the 50-day average (confirms breakdown strength)  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Close position when price touches the opposite Keltner Channel band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs).  
  - Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on recent volatility (e.g., ATR-based stop).  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Place stop-loss **inside** the Keltner Channel (e.g., mid-band or recent swing low/high).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low ADX (<25) to prevent false breakouts.  
- Wait for volume confirmation to reduce whipsaw risk.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ADX (14-period default)** – Trend strength filter.  
2. **Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width)** – Volatility squeeze detection.  
3. **Volume (50-day MA)** – Breakout confirmation.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Adjust Keltner Channel multiplier (e.g., 1.5x ATR for tighter squeezes).  
- Test different ADX thresholds (e.g., 20 for more trades, 30 for higher conviction).  
- Combine with momentum oscillators (e.g., RSI) to avoid overbought/oversold breakouts.  

This strategy capitalizes on high-probability breakouts by combining trend strength, volatility contraction, and volume surge confirmation.
