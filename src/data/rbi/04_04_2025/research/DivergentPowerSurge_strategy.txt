STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentPowerSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Stochastic Oscillator Divergence:** Identifies potential reversals when price makes a lower low but the Stochastic Oscillator makes a higher low (bullish divergence).  
2. **Elder-Ray Index Bull Power Surge:** Confirms buying pressure when the Bull Power (close minus EMA low) shows a significant upward spike.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Ensures validity of the signal with above-average trading volume.  
4. **Keltner Channel Upper Band:** Acts as the exit trigger when price breaches this level, indicating overbought conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bullish divergence on the Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3 settings) in oversold territory (<20).  
- **Condition 2:** Elder-Ray Bull Power surges upward, crossing above its recent average.  
- **Condition 3:** Volume is higher than the 20-period moving average of volume.  
- **Entry:** Long position triggered when all three conditions align.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** Price closes above the Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2x ATR) upper band.  
- **Secondary Exit (Stop Loss):** Place a stop below the most recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2%).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade.  
- Trailing stop can be applied using the Keltner Channel midline for partial exits.  
- Avoid trading during low volatility (ATR below threshold).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)  
2. Elder-Ray Index (13-period EMA for Bear/Bull Power)  
3. Volume + 20-period Volume MA  
4. Keltner Channel (20 EMA, 2x ATR)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines momentum (Stochastic), buying pressure (Elder-Ray), and volume for high-probability reversals.  
- Uses Keltner Channel for dynamic profit-taking instead of fixed targets.  
- Filters out weak signals with volume confirmation.  

**Note:** Works best in ranging or moderately trending markets; avoid strong downtrends without divergence.
