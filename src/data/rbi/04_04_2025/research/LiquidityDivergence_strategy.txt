STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Counter-trend trading approach focusing on liquidity zones
- Uses liquidation cluster levels derived from cumulative liquidation map data
- Requires MACD histogram divergence confirmation
- Identifies exit points through volume profile liquidity voids

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for price to breach a significant liquidation cluster level (key liquidity zone)
- Confirm with MACD histogram showing divergence (price makes new high/low but MACD doesn't confirm)
- Entry triggered when both conditions align (liquidation breach + divergence)

3. Exit Rules:
- Pre-identify liquidity voids using volume profile analysis
- Exit trades when price reaches these pre-identified liquidity voids
- Consider partial profits at intermediate liquidity levels

4. Risk Management:
- Stop loss placed beyond the liquidation cluster level (opposite side of breach)
- Position sizing based on distance to liquidity void targets
- Risk no more than 1-2% per trade
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events

5. Required Indicators:
- Cumulative liquidation map (to identify liquidation clusters)
- MACD histogram (for divergence confirmation)
- Volume profile (to identify liquidity voids for exits)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging or overextended markets
- Requires patience to wait for proper setups
- Multiple timeframe confirmation recommended
- Particularly effective in crypto markets with clear liquidation levels

This strategy combines liquidity analysis with technical divergence for high-probability counter-trend entries, targeting natural liquidity pockets for exits. The unique combination of liquidation map data with traditional technical analysis creates a robust framework for identifying reversal points with favorable risk-reward ratios.
