STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection**: Uses Bollinger Band (BB) width (standard deviation) to identify periods of low volatility when the width contracts below a 10-day moving average.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation**: Requires a breakout above the Keltner Channel (KC) upper band or below the lower band to confirm an entry signal.  
3. **Dynamic Exit Mechanism**: Exits trades when price crosses the opposite KC band or triggers a trailing stop based on 2x the Average True Range (ATR).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. BB width (BB upper - BB lower) is below its 10-day moving average (volatility squeeze condition).  
  2. Price closes above the upper Keltner Channel band.  
- **Short Entry**:  
  1. BB width is below its 10-day moving average.  
  2. Price closes below the lower Keltner Channel band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**:  
  1. Price closes below the lower Keltner Channel band (opposite band crossover).  
  2. Trailing stop: Exit if price drops 2x ATR from the highest high since entry.  
- **Short Exit**:  
  1. Price closes above the upper Keltner Channel band.  
  2. Trailing stop: Exit if price rises 2x ATR from the lowest low since entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for volatility (e.g., using ATR-based sizing).  
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause erratic volatility expansions.  
- Consider a maximum daily loss limit (e.g., 2% of capital).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations) – To measure volatility contraction.  
2. **Keltner Channels** (20-period EMA, 2x ATR multiplier) – For breakout confirmation.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR)** (14-period) – For trailing stop and volatility adjustment.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines BB width contraction (volatility squeeze) with KC breakout for high-probability entries.  
- Uses a dynamic trailing stop (2x ATR) to lock in profits while allowing room for volatility.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring prior low volatility (BB squeeze).  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different BB/KC periods (e.g., 14 vs. 20) for varying asset classes.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (e.g., 1.5x–3x) based on risk tolerance.  
- Filter trades with additional confirmation (e.g., RSI > 50 for longs, < 50 for shorts).
