STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility contractions following liquidation events, combining Bollinger Band analysis with basis divergence and volume-confirmed reversals.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - Measures volatility contraction (20-period SMA, 2 std dev)
2. Spot-CME Basis Divergence - Tracks futures/spot price differentials
3. Volume-Weighted Reversal Candles - Identifies high-conviction turning points

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for liquidation cascade (sharp price move with elevated volume)
2. BBW must cross below threshold (suggesting volatility contraction)
3. Spot-CME basis must show divergence (price moving opposite to basis)
4. Volume-weighted reversal candle must form (close > open with volume > 20-period avg)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary: Take profit at 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry
2. Secondary: Exit if BBW expands beyond entry threshold
3. Emergency: Stop loss at 0.5x ATR from entry

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss mandatory on all positions
3. No trading during scheduled high-impact news events
4. Daily loss limit of 5% across all positions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW)
3. Volume-weighted moving average (VWMA)
4. Average True Range (ATR 14)
5. Spot-CME basis differential indicator

Optimization Notes:
1. Backtest BBW thresholds (typically 0.5-1.5 range)
2. Test various ATR multiples for profit targets
3. Validate basis divergence sensitivity
4. Adjust volume thresholds based on asset liquidity

This strategy works best in crypto and high-beta assets prone to liquidation events, requiring patience to wait for proper setups. The "VoltaicContraction" name reflects both the electrical surge/recovery analogy of liquidations and the precise measurement of volatility contractions.
