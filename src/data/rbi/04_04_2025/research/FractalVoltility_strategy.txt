STRATEGY_NAME: FractalVoltility  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Compression Detection:** Uses Bollinger Band width percentile to identify periods of low volatility (compression).  
2. **Trend Confirmation:** Anchored VWAP slope provides directional bias for breakout trades.  
3. **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Adjusts trade size based on recent fractal dimension, scaling into higher-probability setups.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width percentile < 20 (indicating compression)  
  2. Anchored VWAP slope is positive (uptrend confirmation)  
  3. Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width percentile < 20  
  2. Anchored VWAP slope is negative (downtrend confirmation)  
  3. Price breaks below lower Bollinger Band  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Close position when Bollinger Band width percentile > 80 (high volatility)  
  - Or when price touches opposite Bollinger Band  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) below breakout level for longs, above for shorts  
  - Trailing stop based on fractal dimension volatility  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size adjusted based on fractal dimension:  
  - Higher fractal dimension (more chaotic markets) = smaller position  
  - Lower fractal dimension (smoother trends) = larger position  
- Maximum risk per trade capped at 1% of account  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 StdDev) with width percentile calculation  
2. Anchored VWAP with slope measurement  
3. Fractal dimension indicator (e.g., Hurst exponent or similar)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility cycles (Bollinger) with smart volume profiling (VWAP)  
- Uses fractal mathematics to adapt to market conditions  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring dual confirmation  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different percentile thresholds (15-25 for compression)  
- Adjust VWAP anchor points based on dominant market cycles  
- Calibrate fractal dimension lookback period (typically 50-100 bars)  

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, avoiding whipsaws through its multi-factor confirmation system.
