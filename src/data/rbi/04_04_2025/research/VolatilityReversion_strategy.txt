STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on mean-reversion opportunities during low-volatility market conditions, using ATR for volatility measurement and RSI for timing exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: 20-day ATR (Average True Range) to identify low-volatility conditions
2. Mean-Reversion Trigger: ATR dropping below its 10th percentile threshold
3. Exit Signal: 5-minute RSI crossing above 70 indicating overbought conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Calculate the 20-day ATR percentile ranking daily
2. Enter long position when:
   - Current 20-day ATR drops below its 10th percentile (historically low volatility)
   - Price is above the 200-day moving average (trend filter, optional)

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor 5-minute RSI continuously after entry
2. Exit position when:
   - 5-minute RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition)
   - OR if the position reaches -2% from entry (stop-loss)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1% of capital per trade
2. Stop-loss: -2% from entry price (hard stop)
3. Take-profit: None (rely solely on RSI exit signal)
4. Maximum holding period: 5 trading days (time-based exit)

Required Indicators:
1. 20-day ATR (Average True Range)
2. ATR percentile calculation (requires historical ATR data)
3. 5-minute RSI (14-period recommended)
4. Optional: 200-day moving average for trend filter

Additional Notes:
- Works best in range-bound markets
- Avoid trading during earnings announcements or major news events
- Requires daily monitoring of ATR percentile levels
- Backtest suggested to determine optimal ATR lookback period and percentile threshold for specific instruments

This strategy combines volatility regime identification with short-term overbought signals, targeting the tendency of prices to mean-revert during low-volatility periods. The unique combination of daily ATR analysis with intraday RSI monitoring creates a distinctive approach to volatility-based trading.
