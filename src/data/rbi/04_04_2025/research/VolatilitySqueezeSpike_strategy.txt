STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeSpike  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) to identify periods of low volatility (squeeze) when BBW reaches a 10-day low.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires a volume spike above the 20-day average volume to validate the breakout potential.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** Trades are exited when price closes beyond the outer Keltner Channel bands, signaling a volatility expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long or short position when:  
  1. Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) reaches a 10-day low (indicating a volatility squeeze).  
  2. Volume spikes above its 20-day moving average (confirming participation in the breakout).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the trade when:  
  1. Price closes beyond the outer Keltner Channel band (upper band for long exits, lower band for short exits).  
  2. Alternatively, set a trailing stop or fixed profit target based on volatility-adjusted metrics (e.g., ATR-based stop).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing should account for the tight stop-loss implied by the Bollinger/Keltner setup (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
2. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause erratic volatility expansions.  
3. Filter trades with a higher timeframe trend alignment (e.g., only trade long if the daily trend is up).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations) – to calculate Bandwidth (BBW).  
2. **Volume 20-day Moving Average** – to confirm volume spikes.  
3. **Keltner Channels** (20-period EMA, 2x ATR multiplier) – for breakout exit signals.  
4. Optional: ATR (14-period) for dynamic stop-loss placement.  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy thrives in ranging markets with periodic volatility contractions.  
- Backtest to optimize the BBW lookback period (10-day default) and Keltner Channel settings for your asset.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., candle patterns) for higher-probability entries.
