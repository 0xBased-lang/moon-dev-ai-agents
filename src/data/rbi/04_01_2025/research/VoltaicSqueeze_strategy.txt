STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses Bollinger Band width percentile to identify periods of low volatility (contraction).  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires a crossover of price above the Keltner Channel upper band to confirm breakout validity.  
3. **Dynamic Exit Management:** Implements an ATR-based trailing stop to lock in profits and minimize losses during volatile moves.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Bollinger Band Width Percentile < 20%:** Indicates a volatility contraction (squeeze).  
- **Price Closes Above Keltner Channel Upper Band:** Confirms breakout from the contraction phase.  
- **Both Conditions Must Be Met:** Ensures higher-probability entries by requiring dual confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **ATR Trailing Stop:** Initial stop set at 2x ATR below entry (for long positions). The stop trails upward as price moves favorably, maintaining a 2x ATR distance from the highest close since entry.  
- **Emergency Exit:** If Bollinger Band width percentile expands above 80%, close the trade to avoid potential reversals after extreme volatility expansion.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade based on the distance between entry and ATR stop.  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if the 14-period ATR is below its 20-day average (prevents false breakouts in lethargic markets).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Standard deviation-based bands to measure volatility contraction.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Percentile:** Calculated as (current width / max width over 100 periods) * 100.  
3. **Keltner Channel (20,1.5):** ATR-based channel for breakout confirmation.  
4. **ATR (14):** Used for trailing stop placement and volatility assessment.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines Bollinger Band squeeze detection with Keltner Channel breakout confirmation for higher accuracy.  
- Uses ATR dynamically for both stop placement and volatility filtering.  
- Avoids over-trading by requiring dual confirmation and volatility thresholds.  

**Note:** Works best on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trading; backtest for optimal ATR multiplier adjustments.
