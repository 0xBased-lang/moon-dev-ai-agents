STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityImbalance  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Order Book Imbalance:** The strategy monitors the bid-ask imbalance in the 5-minute order book, entering trades when the imbalance exceeds 2 standard deviations, indicating strong momentum.  
2. **Volatility Squeeze:** Uses Bollinger Band width (BBW) to confirm low volatility conditions—entry is only valid when the BBW is below its 20-period average, signaling a potential breakout.  
3. **Exit Signal:** Positions are closed when price touches the upper Bollinger Band, capitalizing on mean reversion after a momentum move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The bid-ask imbalance (bid volume / ask volume) exceeds 2 standard deviations from its mean, indicating aggressive buying pressure.  
- **Condition 2:** Bollinger Band width (BBW) is below its 20-period moving average, confirming a volatility squeeze.  
- **Entry Action:** Long position triggered when both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit when price reaches the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Stop-Loss (Optional):** Can be set below the lower Bollinger Band or a recent swing low for risk control.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing).  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false imbalances.  
- Consider a trailing stop if the trend extends beyond the upper band.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – For squeeze detection and exit signals.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width (BBW)** – To measure volatility contraction.  
3. **Order Book Imbalance Metric** – Custom calculation of bid/ask volume deviation.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or consolidating markets before breakouts.  
- High-frequency order book data is critical for accurate imbalance readings.  
- Backtest with slippage to account for liquidity gaps.
