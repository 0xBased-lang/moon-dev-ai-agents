STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentVolumetric  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **MACD Histogram Divergence:** Identifies bullish divergence when price makes lower lows while MACD histogram forms higher lows, signaling potential upward momentum.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Confirmation:** Ensures volume supports the bullish divergence by trending upward, validating the strength of the move.  
3. **MACD Signal Line Exit:** Uses the MACD signal line crossing below zero as a clear exit signal to lock in profits or minimize losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bullish MACD histogram divergence (price lower low, MACD histogram higher low).  
- **Condition 2:** OBV must be in an uptrend (higher highs or sustained upward slope).  
- **Action:** Enter long at the close of the candle confirming both conditions.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** MACD signal line crosses *below* the zero line (indicates weakening momentum).  
- **Optional Exit:** Trailing stop or fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) if the signal line crossover is delayed.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the most recent swing low (for divergence trades) or a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%).  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **MACD (12, 26, 9):** Standard settings for histogram and signal line analysis.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** No settings needed; focus on trend direction.  

**Notes:**  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or choppy markets (OBV flat).  
- Works best on daily/weekly timeframes for clearer divergence signals.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., support/resistance) for higher-probability entries.
