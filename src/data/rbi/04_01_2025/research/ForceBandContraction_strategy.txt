STRATEGY_NAME: ForceBand Contraction  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Elder Force Index**: Measures the strength of price movement combined with volume, highlighting potential trend acceleration.  
2. **Bollinger Bandwidth**: Tracks the volatility contraction by measuring the percentage difference between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands.  
3. **Standard Deviation Threshold**: Identifies extreme Force Index spikes (beyond 2 standard deviations) as potential entry signals.  
4. **20-Day Low Bandwidth**: Confirms low volatility conditions, suggesting an imminent breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  - Elder Force Index crosses above +2 standard deviations of its 20-period moving average.  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 20-day low (indicating contraction).  
- **Short Entry**:  
  - Elder Force Index crosses below -2 standard deviations of its 20-period moving average.  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 20-day low.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: Elder Force Index crosses below its 20-period moving average (or a user-defined threshold, e.g., zero line).  
- **Short Exit**: Elder Force Index crosses above its 20-period moving average (or zero line).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**:  
   - Fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade).  
   - Or, a volatility-based stop (e.g., 1.5x the recent ATR).  
2. **Position Sizing**: Adjust based on account risk tolerance (e.g., 1-3% per trade).  
3. **Avoid Overlapping Signals**: Wait for bandwidth to expand after a trade before re-entering.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Elder Force Index (14-period default)**.  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2 default) + Bandwidth Calculation**:  
   - Bandwidth = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band * 100.  
3. **Standard Deviation (20-period) of Force Index** for spike detection.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines momentum (Force Index) with volatility cycles (Bandwidth).  
- Filters false breakouts by requiring both an extreme Force spike *and* low volatility.  
- Exits based on momentum decay, not arbitrary price targets.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different Force Index lookback periods (e.g., 10 vs. 20).  
- Adjust Bandwidth low threshold (e.g., 15-day vs. 20-day).  
- Add a confirmation filter (e.g., price above/below 200MA for trend alignment).  

**Note**: Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends; avoid during high volatility without contraction.
