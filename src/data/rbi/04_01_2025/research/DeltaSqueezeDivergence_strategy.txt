STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaSqueezeDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction signals from Keltner Channels with order flow divergence to identify high-probability reversal setups. The core concept focuses on catching price movements when volatility compression coincides with increasing negative delta divergence, suggesting underlying weakness during apparent consolidation.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier) - Identifies volatility contractions when channels converge
2. Delta Divergence - Measures the difference between price action and cumulative delta (buy/sell pressure)
3. Volatility Expansion - Uses channel breakout or ATR spike for exits

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Keltner Channels to contract to at least 50% of their average width (volatility squeeze)
2. Confirm negative delta divergence (price making higher highs while cumulative delta makes lower highs)
3. Enter short when price breaks below the lower Keltner Channel with confirming delta divergence

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price closes back inside the Keltner Channels (volatility reversion)
2. Secondary Exit: When cumulative delta shows strong positive divergence (order flow reversal)
3. Emergency Exit: If price breaks above upper Keltner Channel with expanding volume

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at recent swing high (for shorts) or above upper Keltner Channel
3. Trail stop using lower Keltner Channel or 2x ATR for profitable trades

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 1.5 ATR multiplier)
2. Cumulative Delta indicator
3. ATR (14-period) for volatility measurement
4. Volume profile for confirmation

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets after strong trends
- Most effective on 15min-4hr timeframes
- Ideal for liquid instruments with good order flow data (futures, major forex pairs)

The DeltaSqueezeDivergence strategy capitalizes on the hidden weakness revealed by order flow during apparent consolidation periods, providing high-probability entries with clearly defined risk parameters.
