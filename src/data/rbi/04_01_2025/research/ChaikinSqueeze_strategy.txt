STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) divergence with Bollinger Bandwidth contraction to identify potential accumulation/distribution phases before volatility expansion. The approach focuses on spotting hidden strength/weakness during low volatility periods and capitalizing on the subsequent breakout.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):**  
   - Measures money flow volume over a set period (typically 20-21 bars)  
   - Positive values indicate buying pressure, negative values show selling pressure  
   - Divergence between price and CMF signals potential reversals  

2. **Bollinger Bandwidth:**  
   - Measures the percentage difference between upper and lower bands  
   - Contraction indicates low volatility and potential impending expansion  
   - Breakout from contraction often leads to strong directional moves  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup Conditions:**  
   - Bollinger Bandwidth reaches lowest 20% of its 50-period range (contraction)  
   - Price forms at least 3 consecutive inside bars within the bands  
   - CMF shows divergence (price makes lower low while CMF makes higher low for long, or vice versa for short)  

2. **Trigger:**  
   - Long Entry: Price closes above upper Bollinger Band with expanding volume  
   - Short Entry: Price closes below lower Bollinger Band with expanding volume  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:**  
   - Opposite Bollinger Band (exit long at lower band, exit short at upper band)  
   - Or when CMF crosses zero in opposite direction  

2. **Stop Loss:**  
   - For longs: Recent swing low below lower band  
   - For shorts: Recent swing high above upper band  
   - Or fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) based on volatility  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade  
2. Stop loss must be placed immediately after entry  
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events when false breakouts are common  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)  
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (50-period lookback for contraction detection)  
3. Chaikin Money Flow (21-period)  
4. Volume indicator (for confirmation)  

**Optimal Conditions:**  
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends  
- Higher timeframe (4H/Daily) provides more reliable signals  
- Combine with sector/overall market direction for confluence  

**Special Notes:**  
- False breakouts are common - wait for closing confirmation  
- CMF divergence must be clear and significant (not minor wobbles)  
- Bandwidth contraction should be at extreme lows compared to recent history
