STRATEGY_NAME: FundingBandit  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Funding Rate Regime Analysis:** The strategy focuses on identifying periods of high funding rates, which typically indicate excessive long positioning in perpetual futures markets.  
2. **Bollinger Band Breakout:** Uses a 4-hour timeframe with Bollinger Bands set to 2 standard deviations (σ) to identify oversold conditions when the price breaches the lower band.  
3. **Trailing Stop Mechanism:** Implements a 3% trailing stop to protect profits and limit downside risk.  
4. **Exit Condition:** Positions are closed when funding rates normalize, signaling a reduction in market bias or over-leveraged conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger:** Price must breach the lower Bollinger Band (2σ) on the 4-hour chart.  
- **Confirmation:** Funding rates must be significantly high (indicating crowded long positions).  
- **Action:** Enter a long position upon the simultaneous occurrence of both conditions.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** Funding rates normalize (return to neutral or below a predefined threshold).  
- **Secondary Exit:** A 3% trailing stop is triggered from the highest point reached after entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to avoid overexposure.  
- **Stop-Loss:** The 3% trailing stop dynamically adjusts to lock in profits while protecting against reversals.  
- **Avoid Overleveraging:** Given the focus on funding rates, ensure leverage is moderate to prevent liquidation during volatile swings.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2σ)** – To identify oversold conditions.  
2. **Funding Rate Data** – To gauge market sentiment and crowding in perpetual futures.  
3. **Trailing Stop Calculator** – To manage exits based on price action.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines mean-reversion (Bollinger Band breach) with sentiment analysis (funding rates).  
- Exploits market inefficiencies during high funding regimes where reversals are more likely.  
- Adaptive exit mechanism based on both trailing stops and funding rate normalization.  

**Note:** This strategy works best in trending or volatile markets where funding rates exhibit clear regimes. Avoid sideways/low-volatility conditions where false signals may occur.
