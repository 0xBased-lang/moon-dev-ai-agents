STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeVwap  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **VWAP Slope Analysis**: The strategy uses the slope of the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) to determine the underlying trend direction. A rising VWAP indicates bullish momentum.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze**: The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Bands contract (squeeze), signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
3. **Volatility Breakout**: Entries are triggered when price breaks above the rising VWAP during a Bollinger Band squeeze, confirming a breakout from low volatility.  
4. **Historical Volatility Percentiles**: Exits are based on Bollinger Band expansion exceeding historical volatility thresholds, indicating overextended price movement.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1**: VWAP slope must be positive (rising) over a defined lookback period (e.g., 5-10 bars).  
- **Condition 2**: Bollinger Bands must be in a squeeze state (bandwidth below a threshold, e.g., 20th percentile of historical bandwidth).  
- **Trigger**: Price breaks and closes above the VWAP while the Bollinger Bands are still tight.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking**: Exit when Bollinger Band expansion exceeds a high volatility percentile (e.g., 80th percentile of historical bandwidth).  
- **Stop-Loss**: Exit if price closes below the VWAP or if Bollinger Band expansion fails to confirm momentum (e.g., reversion back inside bands).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility-adjusted risk (e.g., ATR-based stop distance).  
- Avoid trading during high-volatility regimes unless confirming a breakout.  
- Maximum risk per trade capped at a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2%).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price) – Slope calculation required.  
2. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 Std Dev) – Bandwidth measurement for squeeze detection.  
3. **Historical Volatility Percentiles** (e.g., rolling percentile rank of Bollinger Bandwidth).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Avoid false breakouts by waiting for confirmation (e.g., higher volume on breakout).  
- Backtest optimal parameters for VWAP slope sensitivity and volatility percentiles.  

This strategy combines trend confirmation (VWAP slope) with volatility contraction/expansion (Bollinger Bands) for high-probability breakout trades.
