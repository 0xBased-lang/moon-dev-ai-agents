STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Liquidation Spike Analysis - Focuses on 24-hour long liquidation spikes as a contrarian signal
2. RSI Divergence - Requires 4-hour RSI divergence below 30 for confirmation
3. Fibonacci Retracement - Uses 50% level of liquidation-driven drop as profit target

Entry Rules:
1. Identify a significant spike in long liquidations (24-hour timeframe)
2. Wait for price to show a corresponding drop following liquidation spike
3. Confirm bullish RSI divergence (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low) on 4-hour chart
4. RSI must be below 30 during divergence formation
5. Enter long position when all conditions align

Exit Rules:
1. Calculate Fibonacci retracement levels from:
   - Swing high (pre-liquidation spike price)
   - Swing low (post-liquidation spike price)
2. Take profit at 50% retracement level
3. Consider additional confirmation (e.g., candlestick pattern) at retracement level
4. Stop loss placed below recent swing low

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance between entry and stop loss
2. Recommended risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
3. Avoid trading during high volatility events that might cause cascading liquidations
4. Maximum daily loss limit: 5% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation data feed (24-hour timeframe)
2. RSI (14-period recommended) on 4-hour chart
3. Fibonacci retracement tool
4. Price chart with clear swing high/low identification

Additional Notes:
1. Works best in trending markets where liquidations create temporary oversold conditions
2. More effective on liquid assets with significant leverage available
3. Requires monitoring of funding rates and open interest for confirmation
4. Ideal for crypto markets where liquidations are more frequent and impactful
5. Backtest recommended for specific asset classes as behavior may vary
