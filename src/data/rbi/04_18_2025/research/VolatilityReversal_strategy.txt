STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Dynamic Support/Resistance Levels:** The strategy uses a 50-period volume-weighted standard deviation channel to identify key price boundaries. These levels adapt to market volatility and volume, providing more relevant zones for potential reversals.  
2. **Divergence Filtering:** The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Fisher Transform indicators are used to confirm reversals. Divergences between price action and these indicators help filter high-probability trades.  
3. **Short-Term Focus:** The strategy is designed for quick reversals, capitalizing on overextended price moves that breach dynamic levels but show weakening momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Price Breach:** Enter a trade when price breaches the upper or lower boundary of the 50-period volume-weighted standard deviation channel.  
   - **Short Entry:** Price breaks above the upper channel boundary, but CMF shows bearish divergence (price makes higher highs while CMF makes lower highs).  
   - **Long Entry:** Price breaks below the lower channel boundary, but CMF shows bullish divergence (price makes lower lows while CMF makes higher lows).  
2. **Fisher Transform Confirmation:** The Fisher Transform should show extreme values (overbought/oversold) aligning with the divergence signal for additional confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Close the trade when price retraces to the midpoint of the volume-weighted standard deviation channel.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss just beyond the opposite channel boundary (for shorts, below the lower boundary; for longs, above the upper boundary).  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** If the trade doesnâ€™t reach the profit target within a set number of bars (e.g., 5-10 periods), exit to avoid prolonged exposure.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Strict adherence to stop levels to limit downside.  
3. **Avoid Overlapping Trades:** Do not enter a new trade until the previous one is closed to prevent overexposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted Standard Deviation Channel (50-period):** Defines dynamic support/resistance.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Identifies divergences to filter trades.  
3. **Fisher Transform:** Confirms extreme conditions and adds confluence.  

This strategy thrives in ranging or mildly trending markets where reversals are frequent. It avoids strong trending environments where breakouts are more likely to sustain.
