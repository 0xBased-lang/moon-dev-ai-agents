STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityFisherFade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines Fisher Transform indicator for identifying potential reversal points
- Uses order book delta analysis to detect liquidity clusters (areas of significant buying/selling pressure)
- Incorporates Bollinger Bands around a 20-period median price channel for exit signals
- Designed to fade price extremes by trading against overextended moves

2. Entry Rules:
- Look for Fisher Transform values crossing above +2.5 (for short entries) or below -2.5 (for long entries)
- Confirm the presence of a liquidity cluster in the order book delta at the same price level
- Entry is triggered when price reaches the identified liquidity cluster level with confirming Fisher Transform extreme

3. Exit Rules:
- For long positions: Exit when price penetrates the upper Bollinger Band of the 20-period median price channel
- For short positions: Exit when price penetrates the lower Bollinger Band of the 20-period median price channel
- Alternative exit: When Fisher Transform crosses back through zero in the opposite direction

4. Risk Management:
- Stop loss placed beyond the liquidity cluster zone (typically 1.5-2x the average cluster width)
- Position sizing based on distance to stop loss to maintain consistent risk per trade
- Avoid trading during high volatility periods when Bollinger Bands are expanding rapidly

5. Required Indicators:
- Fisher Transform (9-14 period recommended)
- Order Book Delta analyzer (to identify liquidity clusters)
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) applied to median price channel
- Median Price Channel (20-period high+low+close/3)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets with clear support/resistance levels
- Requires careful monitoring of order book dynamics
- Most effective on liquid assets with sufficient order book depth
- Timeframe recommendation: 15min to 4hr charts for optimal results

This strategy capitalizes on the combination of technical extremes (Fisher Transform) and market microstructure (liquidity clusters) to identify high-probability reversal points, with Bollinger Bands providing objective exit criteria. The unique LiquidityFisherFade approach merges technical analysis with order flow dynamics for contrarian trading opportunities.
