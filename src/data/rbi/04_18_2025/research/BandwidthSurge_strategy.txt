STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandwidthSurge strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume confirmation for high-probability breakout trades. This approach capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by emerging momentum.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures periods of exceptionally low volatility
2. Volume Profile Confirmation: Validates emerging interest with volume expansion
3. ATR-Based Profit Target: Uses volatility-adjusted exit points

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width (20,2) must reach its lowest point in 20 days
2. Confirmation: 5-day EMA of volume must cross above 20-day EMA of volume
3. Execution: Enter long on the next candle's open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 1.5x the 14-period ATR from entry price
2. Stop Loss: Consider using 1x ATR below entry for risk management
3. Time Exit: Optional - Close position after 5 days if target not hit

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Either fixed ATR stop or below recent swing low
3. Filter: Avoid trading during major economic events that may distort volatility

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for width calculation
2. Volume EMA (5-period and 20-period)
3. Average True Range (14-period)
4. Volume Profile (standard)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets, may produce false signals in choppy conditions
- Consider adding a trend filter (e.g., price above 200MA) for higher timeframes
- Backtest suggested for optimal ATR multiplier (1.5x may vary by instrument)
