STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Counter-trend trading approach capitalizing on extreme volatility events
2. Uses Bollinger Bands (3 standard deviations) to identify overextended price moves
3. Volume surge filter (200% above 20-day average) confirms unusual market activity
4. 20-period SMA serves as mean reversion target
5. ATR-based trailing stop (1.5x) for dynamic risk management

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger: Price must close outside the 3-standard deviation Bollinger Band
2. Confirmation: Volume must be at least 200% of the 20-day average volume
3. Entry Type: Market order at next available price after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Target: 20-period SMA (price crossing back inside the band is not required)
2. Dynamic Protection: Trailing stop at 1.5x the current 14-period ATR value
3. Exit Priority: Whichever condition (SMA or trailing stop) is hit first

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1.5x ATR stop distance
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. No new entries allowed until current position is closed
4. Recommended maximum of 3 concurrent positions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 3 standard deviations)
2. Volume indicator with 20-day average
3. 20-period Simple Moving Average
4. 14-period Average True Range (ATR)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volatility patterns
- Works across multiple timeframes (15min to daily recommended)
- Requires monitoring for potential trend continuation despite extreme readings
- Volume filter helps avoid false signals during low-liquidity periods

Optimization Considerations:
- Adjust standard deviation parameter (2.5-3.5 range)
- Test different volume thresholds (150-250%)
- Experiment with SMA periods (10-30)
- Vary ATR multiplier (1.25-2.0) based on volatility tolerance
