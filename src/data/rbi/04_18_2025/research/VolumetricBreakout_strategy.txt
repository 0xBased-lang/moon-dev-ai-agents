STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Confirmation:** Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) to confirm a bullish trend.  
2. **Momentum Filter:** Requires ADX (Average Directional Index) to be above 25, ensuring strong trend momentum.  
3. **Volume Spike:** Entry is only valid if trading volume exceeds the 20-day average, confirming participation in the breakout.  
4. **Dynamic Exit:** Uses a trailing ATR (Average True Range) stop to lock in profits and protect against reversals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Golden Cross:** Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross above the 200-period EMA.  
2. **ADX Confirmation:** Ensure ADX is above 25, indicating strong trend strength.  
3. **Volume Spike:** Confirm that the current trading volume is higher than the 20-day average volume.  
4. **Entry Point:** Enter long on the next candle after all conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Trailing ATR Stop:** Set a trailing stop based on a multiple of ATR (e.g., 2x ATR). Adjust the stop upward as the price moves in your favor.  
2. **Stop Adjustment:** Recalculate the ATR stop daily or per candle, trailing it below the highest price since entry.  
3. **Emergency Exit:** Exit immediately if the 50-period EMA crosses back below the 200-period EMA (Death Cross).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Placement:** Initial stop can be placed below a recent swing low or using a fixed ATR multiple (e.g., 3x ATR).  
3. **Avoid Overleveraging:** Ensure trades align with overall portfolio risk tolerance.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period EMA** (Exponential Moving Average)  
2. **200-period EMA** (Exponential Moving Average)  
3. **ADX (14-period)** with threshold set to 25  
4. **Volume (20-day average)**  
5. **ATR (14-period)** for trailing stop calculation  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.  
- Backtest to optimize ATR multiples for trailing stops and ADX thresholds.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., breakout above resistance) for higher-probability entries.  

**Unique Aspect:** The combination of volume spikes with EMA crossovers and ADX filtering creates a high-probability breakout strategy with dynamic risk management.
