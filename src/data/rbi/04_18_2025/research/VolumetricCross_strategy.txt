STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricCross  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **EMA Crossover:** Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as the primary trend confirmation.  
2. **Volume Spike:** Requires a significant spike in trading volume to validate the crossover signal, ensuring strong momentum.  
3. **RSI-Based Exit:** Exits positions when the RSI exceeds 70, targeting mean-reversion to avoid overbought conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  - The 50-period EMA crosses above the 200-period EMA.  
  - The crossover occurs alongside a high-volume spike (e.g., volume exceeding 1.5x the 20-period average).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close the long position when:  
  - The RSI (14-period) exceeds 70, indicating overbought conditions.  
  - Alternatively, use a trailing stop or fixed profit target (e.g., 2:1 risk-reward ratio) for additional exit flexibility.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set a stop-loss below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3% below entry).  
- Position sizing should align with overall risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period).  
4. Volume indicator (e.g., 20-period average volume for spike detection).  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid sideways or choppy conditions.  
- Volume confirmation reduces false signals from EMA crossovers.  
- RSI exit ensures timely profit-taking before potential reversals.  

This strategy combines trend-following (EMA crossover) with momentum confirmation (volume) and mean-reversion (RSI) for a balanced approach.
