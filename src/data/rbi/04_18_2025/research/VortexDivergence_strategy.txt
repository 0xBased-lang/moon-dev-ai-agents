STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI)**: Used to confirm the prevailing trend direction. The strategy looks for the VI+ (positive trend) to cross above VI- (negative trend) for bullish signals and vice versa for bearish signals.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Divergence**: Identifies potential reversals when price makes a higher high but OBV makes a lower high (bearish divergence) or price makes a lower low but OBV makes a higher low (bullish divergence).  
3. **Keltner Channel**: Acts as a dynamic support/resistance framework. The midpoint serves as a retracement entry point, while the opposite band defines the profit target.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  2. Bullish OBV divergence forms (price lower low, OBV higher low).  
  3. Price retraces to the Keltner Channel midpoint.  
- **Short Entry**:  
  1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  2. Bearish OBV divergence forms (price higher high, OBV lower high).  
  3. Price retraces to the Keltner Channel midpoint.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**: Exit at the opposite Keltner Channel band (upper band for longs, lower band for shorts).  
- **Stop Loss**: Place below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the recent swing high (for shorts), or use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on account risk (e.g., 1% per trade).  
2. Stop loss is mandatory to limit downside.  
3. Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) (default period: 14).  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV).  
3. Keltner Channel (typical settings: 20-period EMA, 2x ATR multiplier).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (VI) with volume-based divergence (OBV) for high-probability reversals.  
- Uses Keltner Channel for disciplined retracement entries and profit targets.  
- Filters out noise by requiring alignment of trend, volume, and price structure.
