STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySpikeReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands, ADX, and volume analysis to identify potential reversal opportunities in low-trend environments with heightened volatility.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** - Identifies overbought/oversold levels relative to recent volatility  
2. **ADX (14-period)** - Measures trend strength (values below 20 indicate weak/no trend)  
3. **Volume Spike** - 30-day moving average comparison for confirmation  

**Entry Rules (Long):**  
1. Price must touch or cross the lower Bollinger Band  
2. ADX must be below 20 (indicating weak trend)  
3. Current volume must exceed 30-day average volume  
All three conditions must be met simultaneously  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. Primary exit: Price reaches upper Bollinger Band  
2. Optional stop-loss: Close below lower Bollinger Band (for aggressive risk management)  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing should account for the distance between Bollinger Bands  
2. Consider 1:2 risk-reward ratio (entry to lower band vs. entry to upper band)  
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)  
2. ADX (14 periods)  
3. Volume + 30-day moving average of volume  

**Optimal Conditions:**  
- Works best in ranging markets  
- More effective on higher timeframes (4H/Daily)  
- Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Combine with candlestick patterns for additional confirmation  
- Backtest to determine optimal volume spike threshold (may vary by asset)  
- Consider filtering with RSI to avoid extreme oversold conditions
