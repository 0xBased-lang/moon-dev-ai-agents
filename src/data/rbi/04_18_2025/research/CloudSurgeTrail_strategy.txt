STRATEGY_NAME: CloudSurgeTrail

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Ichimoku Cloud analysis with volume confirmation and momentum filtering to trade breakouts with dynamic trailing stops. Here are the key components:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Ichimoku Cloud (15min timeframe): Primary trend filter and breakout detection
- Volume Surge (2x average): Confirmation of breakout strength
- Stochastic RSI: Momentum filter to avoid overextended conditions
- Chandelier Exit: Adaptive trailing stop mechanism

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Long Entry:
  1. Price breaks ABOVE Ichimoku Cloud (Senkou Span)
  2. Volume exceeds 2x 20-period average volume
  3. Stoch RSI (14,3,3) is below 80 (not overbought)
  4. Cloud must be bullish (Price > Cloud, Senkou Span A > Senkou Span B)

- Short Entry:
  1. Price breaks BELOW Ichimoku Cloud (Senkou Span)
  2. Volume exceeds 2x 20-period average volume
  3. Stoch RSI (14,3,3) is above 20 (not oversold)
  4. Cloud must be bearish (Price < Cloud, Senkou Span A < Senkou Span B)

3. EXIT RULES:
- Primary Exit: Chandelier Exit (22-period, 3x ATR) trails the position
- Secondary Exit: 
  - For longs: Stoch RSI crosses below 80
  - For shorts: Stoch RSI crosses above 20
- Emergency Exit: Price re-enters opposite side of Cloud

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Initial stop placed at opposite side of Cloud at entry
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
- Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Ichimoku Cloud (9,26,52 standard settings)
- Volume (20-period average)
- Stochastic RSI (14,3,3 settings)
- Chandelier Exit (22-period, 3x ATR multiplier)
- ATR (14-period for Chandelier calculation)

6. SPECIAL NOTES:
- Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- Requires confirmation from all components - no partial signals
- Cloud thickness adds validity - thicker clouds = stronger signals
- Avoid trading during major news events due to volume distortions

This strategy combines trend confirmation (Ichimoku), momentum filtering (Stoch RSI), volume validation, and dynamic risk management (Chandelier) for a comprehensive breakout approach.
