STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Bollinger Band Squeeze (20-day period, width < 2% threshold)
- Volume Surge (150% of 50-day average volume)
- Volatility-based exit (3x ATR trailing stop)
- Momentum confirmation (RSI > 70 exit filter)

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width contraction below 2% (squeeze)
- Confirmation: Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band
- Volume Filter: Current volume must exceed 150% of 50-day MA volume
- All three conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: 3x ATR (14-period) trailing stop
- Secondary Exit: RSI (14-period) crosses above 70
- Whichever condition triggers first will close the position

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing should be based on ATR to maintain consistent risk
- Stop loss is dynamic (3x ATR trailing)
- Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
- Consider implementing a maximum daily loss limit

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Bollinger Band Width indicator
- Volume (50-day MA)
- ATR (14-period)
- RSI (14-period)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending market conditions
- Backtest suggested timeframes: 1H-4H for intraday, daily for swing trading
- Requires confirmation of volume surge to validate breakout
- Avoid using during earnings announcements or major news events
- Complementary filters could include ADX > 25 for trend strength confirmation

This strategy combines volatility contraction, breakout confirmation, and volume surge to identify high-probability trades with defined risk parameters. The "SqueezeSurge" name reflects both the Bollinger Band squeeze setup and the required volume surge for validation.
