STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicVwapBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines dynamic VWAP envelopes with ATR-based adjustments and volume confirmation for high-probability breakout trading.

Key Components:
1. VWAP Envelope: Uses Volume Weighted Average Price as the baseline
2. ATR Adjustment: Dynamically widens/narrows the envelope based on volatility
3. Volume Acceleration: Requires trading volume to exceed 5-day rolling average
4. Breakout Confirmation: Price must close beyond the adjusted VWAP envelope

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price closes ABOVE the upper VWAP envelope (VWAP + ATR-adjusted band)
   - Current volume > 5-day rolling average volume
   - Enter at next open or on pullback to broken envelope level

2. Short Entry:
   - Price closes BELOW the lower VWAP envelope (VWAP - ATR-adjusted band)
   - Current volume > 5-day rolling average volume
   - Enter at next open or on pullback to broken envelope level

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - 1.5x ATR target from entry point
   - OR when price re-enters VWAP envelope

2. Stop Loss:
   - Fixed at 1x ATR from entry
   - OR when opposite envelope is touched (for counter-trend protection)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade (ATR stop determines share quantity)
2. Maximum 5 concurrent positions open
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (cool-down period)

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
2. ATR (14-period recommended)
3. Volume (5-day simple moving average)
4. Custom VWAP envelope bands (VWAP Â± ATR multiplier)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ATR multipliers (1.5-3x typical range)
- Adjust volume acceleration threshold (1.2-2x average)
- Consider time-based exits (e.g., 3-5 day hold period)

This strategy excels in trending markets with expanding volatility, using volume confirmation to filter false breakouts while dynamically adjusting to changing market conditions through the ATR component.
