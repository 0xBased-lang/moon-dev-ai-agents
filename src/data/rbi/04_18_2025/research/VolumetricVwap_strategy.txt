STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricVwap  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This intraday momentum strategy combines VWAP crossovers with high-volume surges to identify strong directional moves, using Bollinger Band %B for precise exits.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **VWAP Crossover**: Primary trend indicator where price crossing above/below VWAP signals momentum direction  
2. **Volume Surge Filter**: Requires 15-minute volume exceeding 90th percentile (calculated from recent 20-period lookback)  
3. **Bollinger Band %B**: Exit mechanism using overbought/oversold thresholds (0.8 for long exits, 0.2 for short exits)  

**Entry Rules (Long):**  
- Price crosses above VWAP  
- Current 15-minute volume > 90th percentile of last 20 periods  
- Enter on next candle open  

**Entry Rules (Short):**  
- Price crosses below VWAP  
- Current 15-minute volume > 90th percentile of last 20 periods  
- Enter on next candle open  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Long positions: Close when %B crosses 0.8 (overbought)  
- Short positions: Close when %B crosses 0.2 (oversold)  
- Optional: Time-based exit at session close  

**Risk Management:**  
- Fixed % risk per trade (e.g., 1% of capital)  
- Stop-loss at recent swing low/high or fixed ATR multiple  
- No new entries after 2:30 PM ET to avoid end-of-day volatility  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)  
2. Volume Percentile (90th threshold)  
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations) with %B calculation  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different volume percentile thresholds (85th-95th)  
- Adjust Bollinger Band parameters for different volatility regimes  
- Consider adding ADX filter (>25) to confirm trend strength  

This strategy excels in capturing explosive intraday moves while using volume confirmation to filter false breakouts, with the %B exit providing disciplined profit-taking.
