STRATEGY_NAME: FibroVolCluster

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Fibonacci retracement cluster identification (multiple Fib levels converging in tight price zone)
- Volatility contraction detection (measured by narrowing Bollinger Bands or ATR below threshold)
- On-balance volume divergence confirmation (price making lower highs while OBV makes higher highs, or vice versa)
- Swing point analysis for stop placement (using recent significant highs/lows)

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for price to consolidate within a Fibonacci cluster zone (38.2%-61.8% retracement area with multiple Fib levels converging)
- Confirm low volatility (Bollinger Band width < X% of price or ATR(14) below Y-period average)
- Require OBV divergence in direction of breakout (bullish: price lower lows, OBV higher lows / bearish: price higher highs, OBV lower highs)
- Enter on breakout candle closing beyond cluster boundary with above conditions met

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit targets at 1:1.5 risk-reward ratio minimum
- Secondary target at next significant Fibonacci extension level (127% or 161.8%)
- Trail stop to breakeven after 1:1 risk-reward achieved
- Exit on OBV reversal signal (break of OBV trendline)

4. Risk Management:
- Initial stop placed beyond opposite side of consolidation cluster
- Alternative stop placement at recent swing extreme (last significant high/low)
- Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade
- Maximum 5% portfolio exposure at any time

5. Required Indicators:
- Fibonacci retracement tool (multiple timeframes recommended)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) or ATR(14) for volatility measurement
- On-balance volume indicator
- Price swing detection tool (for stop placement)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best performance in trending markets after pullbacks
- Higher timeframe clusters (daily/weekly) carry more weight
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Requires patience for proper cluster formation (typically 5-15 candles)

This strategy combines Fibonacci harmonic patterns with volume confirmation and volatility filtering to identify high-probability breakout opportunities while maintaining strict risk control. The name "FibroVolCluster" reflects the core elements: Fibonacci retracements (Fibro), volatility contraction (Vol), and price clustering behavior.
