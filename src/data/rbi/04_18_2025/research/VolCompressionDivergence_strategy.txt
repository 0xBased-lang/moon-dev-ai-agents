STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressionDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) to identify periods of extreme low volatility when the bandwidth falls below its historical 10th percentile.  
2. **Sentiment Divergence Confirmation:** Requires a surge in the put/call ratio (PCR) divergence, indicating bearish sentiment during low volatility, to confirm potential reversal setups.  
3. **Mean Reversion Exit:** Exits trades when either the BBW or PCR reverts to its mean, signaling the end of the compression or sentiment extreme.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) must drop below its 10th percentile over a lookback period (e.g., 20-50 days).  
- **Condition 2:** Put/call ratio (PCR) must show a significant surge (e.g., >1.5x its 10-day moving average) while BBW remains compressed.  
- **Entry Signal:** Go short (or prepare for a downside breakout) when both conditions align.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Condition 1:** BBW expands back above its 20th percentile (mean reversion of volatility).  
- **Exit Condition 2:** PCR drops below its 10-day moving average (mean reversion of sentiment).  
- **Whichever occurs first triggers the exit.**  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility-adjusted risk (e.g., ATR-based stop).  
- Initial stop-loss placed at recent swing high (for shorts) or low (for longs).  
- Trailing stop can be used if the trade moves favorably.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW):** Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band (SMA).  
2. **Put/Call Ratio (PCR):** Equity or index options PCR, smoothed with a moving average for divergence detection.  
3. **Percentile Analysis:** Historical BBW percentile ranking (e.g., 10-day lookback for dynamic thresholds).  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in range-bound or transitioning markets.  
- Avoid during strong trending phases where volatility may stay elevated.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., breakdown below support) for higher-probability entries.  

This strategy capitalizes on the "calm before the storm" effect, where low volatility and extreme sentiment often precede sharp moves. The name **VolCompressionDivergence** reflects its dual focus on volatility compression and sentiment divergence.
