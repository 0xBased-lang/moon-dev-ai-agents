STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicTrendSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicTrendSync strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum filtering to identify high-probability trades in trending markets. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to create a robust trading framework.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification (EMA Crossover):
   - 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
   - 200-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
   - The crossover acts as the primary trend confirmation signal

2. Trend Strength Filter (ADX):
   - ADX (Average Directional Index) set to 25 threshold
   - Ensures trades are only taken in strong trending markets

3. Momentum Exit Signal (RSI):
   - RSI (Relative Strength Index) set to 70 overbought threshold
   - Provides objective exit criteria for profit-taking

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50-EMA must cross above 200-EMA (golden cross)
2. Secondary Filter: ADX must be above 25 (confirming strong trend)
3. Both conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking: RSI crosses below 70 from above
2. Emergency Exit: If 50-EMA crosses back below 200-EMA (death cross)
3. Stop-loss: Recommended at recent swing low or 2% of account equity

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop-loss placement: Below recent swing low or fixed percentage
3. Trade frequency: Limited by strict ADX filter
4. Avoid trading during low ADX periods (<25)

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. ADX (14-period standard setting) with 25 threshold
4. RSI (14-period standard setting) with 70 level

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for daily or 4-hour timeframes in trending markets
- Works well with liquid instruments (major forex pairs, indices)
- Requires patience as signals may be infrequent due to ADX filter
- Complementary volume analysis can enhance signal reliability

This strategy systematically combines trend-following with momentum analysis, creating a disciplined approach to capture extended moves while avoiding false signals in ranging markets. The ADX filter significantly improves quality over basic EMA crossover systems.
