STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The LiquidityBandwidth strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction analysis with funding rate extremes to identify high-probability breakout opportunities targeting liquidity voids. This approach capitalizes on periods of market compression followed by potential explosive moves.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth Threshold: Measures the percentage difference between upper and lower Bollinger Bands (typically 20-period, 2 std dev)
2. Funding Rate Extremes: Monitors negative funding rate spikes indicating excessive short positioning
3. Volume Node Analysis: Identifies high-volume price levels that may act as liquidity targets

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: 
   - Bollinger Bandwidth reaches lowest 5% of its 200-day historical range (extreme contraction)
   - Negative funding rate spikes to 2 standard deviations above its 30-day average
2. Confirmation:
   - Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band (for long) or below lower band (for short)
   - Volume on breakout exceeds 20-period average by 50%

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - Primary: Nearest significant volume node beyond recent swing high/low (1.5x average true range)
   - Secondary: Next major liquidity zone (3x average true range)
2. Stop Loss:
   - Opposite side of breakout candle (for aggressive)
   - Middle Bollinger Band (for conservative)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (BB width %)
3. Funding Rate oscillator (30-day z-score)
4. Volume profile (identifying nodes)
5. Average True Range (14)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust bandwidth threshold based on asset volatility (lower for high-vol assets)
- Fine-tune funding rate z-score based on market regime
- Volume node significance should use at least 2 weeks of data

This strategy works best in:
- Crypto perpetual futures markets
- High-liquidity assets with clear funding rate patterns
- Periods following extended consolidation
