STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinSqueezeFlow

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines money flow dynamics with volatility contraction to identify high-probability long entries, using a multi-indicator confirmation system.

Key Components:
1. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) - Measures buying/selling pressure
2. Bollinger Bandwidth - Tracks volatility contraction
3. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) - Acts as dynamic exit threshold

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 5-day SMA of CMF must cross above zero (bullish money flow)
2. Confirmation Condition: Bollinger Bandwidth must be at a 3-month low (volatility squeeze)
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously for valid entry

Exit Rules:
1. Close position after two consecutive daily closes below 20-period VWAP
2. Optional: Consider partial profit-taking at 2:1 risk-reward ratio

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop-loss: Initial stop below recent swing low or 2ATR below entry
3. Volatility filter: Avoid trading if average true range (ATR) is below 30-day average

Required Indicators:
1. Chaikin Money Flow (21-day period, 5-day SMA)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation)
3. Bollinger Bandwidth (calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band)
4. VWAP (20-period)
5. Optional: ATR (14-period) for volatility assessment

Unique Aspects:
- Combines money flow confirmation with volatility squeeze pattern
- Uses VWAP instead of traditional moving averages for exits
- Requires simultaneous indicator alignment for higher-probability entries
- Particularly effective in transitioning from low to moderate volatility regimes

Optimization Notes:
- Test different SMA periods for CMF (3-7 days)
- Experiment with VWAP periods (10-30) for exits
- Consider adding volume confirmation (e.g., above 50-day average)
