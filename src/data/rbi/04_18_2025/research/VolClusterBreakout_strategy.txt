STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on capturing volatility breakouts during clustered liquidation events, combining liquidation level analysis with volume spikes and negative funding rates for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Detection: Identify price levels with high concentration of liquidations (using liquidation heatmaps or orderbook analysis)
2. Volume Spike Confirmation: Requires at least 2x average volume spike coinciding with liquidation level breach
3. Negative Funding Rate: Must have negative funding rates (indicating short squeeze potential)
4. ATR-Based Targets: Uses Average True Range for dynamic profit taking

Entry Rules:
1. LONG Entry when:
   - Price breaches a clustered liquidation level (key support/resistance)
   - Volume spikes to 2x 20-period average volume
   - Funding rate is negative (below -0.01%)
   - Confirmed with price closing beyond liquidation level

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Primary target: 1.5x ATR(14) from entry
   - Secondary target: 3x ATR(14) from entry (partial exit)
2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop: 0.75x ATR(14) below entry
   - Trailing stop: 0.5x ATR(14) once price reaches 1x ATR profit
3. Funding Rate Reversal:
   - Immediate exit if funding turns positive (+0.01% or higher)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily trades: 3 (to avoid overexposure)
3. Time filter: Only trade during high liquidity hours (UTC 12:00-16:00)

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation level data (from exchanges or third-party providers)
2. Volume indicator (20-period average)
3. ATR(14)
4. Funding rate monitor
5. Price action confirmation (candlestick patterns)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in high volatility crypto markets (BTC, ETH)
- Most effective when liquidation clusters align with key technical levels
- Avoid during low liquidity periods or major news events

Note: This strategy requires real-time monitoring of liquidation levels and funding rates, making it more suitable for algorithmic execution than manual trading.
