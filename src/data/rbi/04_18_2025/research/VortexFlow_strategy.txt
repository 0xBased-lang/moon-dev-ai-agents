STRATEGY_NAME: VortexFlow  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Tracks directional movement using +VI (bullish) and -VI (bearish) lines. A bullish crossover (+VI crossing above -VI) signals potential uptrends.  
2. **Money Flow Index (MFI):** Momentum oscillator (0–100) measuring buying/selling pressure. Crosses above 30 indicate emerging bullish momentum, while >70 suggests overbought conditions.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires expanding volume during the VI/MFI signals to validate strength.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long when:  
  - +VI crosses above -VI (Vortex bullish crossover).  
  - MFI simultaneously crosses above 30.  
  - Volume is higher than the prior 5-period average (confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close position if:  
  - +VI crosses below -VI (Vortex bearish flip).  
  - MFI rises above 70 (overbought threshold).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Set below the recent swing low or use a trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR).  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk ≤1–2% of capital per trade.  
- **Filter:** Avoid entries during low-volume periods or if price is below 200-period MA (trend context).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) with default 14-period setting.  
2. Money Flow Index (MFI) with 14-period setting.  
3. Volume (expanding relative to 5-period average).  
4. Optional: 200-period MA for trend bias.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend direction (VI), momentum shifts (MFI), and volume confirmation to filter high-probability reversals in emerging uptrends. Avoids choppy markets via volume/MFI thresholds.
