STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricEMASurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) - Primary trend filter
2. Volume analysis - Confirmation via 20-day average volume spike (2x threshold)
3. 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Overbought exit signal

Entry Rules:
1. Price must close above the 200-day EMA (confirms bullish trend structure)
2. Current trading volume must exceed 2x the 20-day average volume (confirms strong participation)
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously on the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit: When 14-day RSI crosses below 70 (indicates potential overbought reversal)
2. Optional emergency exit: If price closes back below 200-day EMA before RSI trigger

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Recommend 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss placement: Below recent swing low or 2-3% below entry price
3. Trailing stop option: Can trail stop below 20-day EMA after entry

Required Indicators:
1. 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. Volume indicator with 20-day average calculation
3. 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for daily timeframe on liquid assets
- Volume spike requirement filters out weak breakouts
- RSI exit helps capture majority of trend while avoiding late-stage reversals
- Works particularly well in transitioning markets from bearish to bullish trends

Optimization Considerations:
- Can test different EMA periods (150-250 day range)
- Volume multiplier can be adjusted between 1.8x-2.5x
- RSI exit threshold could be tested between 65-75
