STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFractal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility clustering detection with fractal efficiency confirmation and dynamic Renko-based exits for a multi-dimensional approach to trading volatility regimes.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Z-Score Trigger (Primary Entry Signal)
   - Calculates 3-day exponential volatility z-score
   - Threshold set at 2.5 standard deviations
   - Identifies periods of significant volatility expansion

2. Fractal Efficiency Confirmation (Secondary Filter)
   - Measures price efficiency using fractal dimension
   - Requires breakout above efficiency threshold
   - Filters false volatility spikes

3. Dynamic Renko Exit Mechanism
   - Uses adaptive brick size based on volatility
   - Triggers exit on brick reversal pattern
   - Provides clean trend-following exits

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: 3-day exponential volatility z-score > 2.5
2. Confirmation: Fractal efficiency breakout occurs
3. Direction: Trade in direction of volatility expansion
   - Long if volatility expansion occurs during uptrend
   - Short if volatility expansion occurs during downtrend

Exit Rules:
1. Main Exit: Renko brick reversal pattern forms
   - For longs: First red brick after series of green bricks
   - For shorts: First green brick after series of red bricks
2. Emergency Exit: Volatility z-score drops below 1.0

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Volatility-adjusted (1% risk per trade)
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Initial: 2x recent average true range
   - Trailing: Adjusted with Renko brick progression
3. Maximum Drawdown: 5% account limit

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Volatility Z-Score (3-day lookback)
2. Fractal Efficiency Index (custom calculation)
3. Dynamic Renko Bricks (volatility-adjusted sizing)
4. Average True Range (14-period for stop calculation)

Optimization Notes:
1. Volatility z-score threshold can be adjusted between 2.0-3.0
2. Fractal efficiency period can be optimized (5-10 days typical)
3. Renko brick size multiplier can be tuned to market conditions

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear volatility regimes, while the fractal filter helps avoid false signals during choppy periods. The Renko exits provide clean trend-following while locking in profits during volatility contractions.
