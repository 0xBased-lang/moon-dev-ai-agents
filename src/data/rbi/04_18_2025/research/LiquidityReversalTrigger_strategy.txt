STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityReversalTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on liquidity-driven reversals by identifying high-density liquidation clusters and combining them with volatility-based exits. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Liquidation Cluster Detection: Uses aggregated stop-loss order book data to identify high-density zones where many stop orders cluster
- Volatility Filter: 1-hour ATR (Average True Range) compared against 5-day average
- Reversal Confirmation: Price approaching these liquidation zones triggers entries

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Identify high-density liquidation clusters from stop-loss order book data
- Wait for price to approach within 0.5% of the cluster level
- Confirm with bearish price action (e.g., rejection wicks, decreasing momentum)
- Enter short position at cluster boundary or on break below recent support

3. EXIT RULES:
- Primary Exit: When 1-hour ATR spikes above its 5-day average
- Secondary Exit: If price moves 1.5x the initial risk in profit (trail stop)
- Emergency Exit: If price moves 2% beyond the liquidation cluster against position

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- Initial stop placed 1% above the liquidation cluster (for shorts)
- Never trade during major news events when liquidity patterns may distort
- Daily loss limit of 5% of capital

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Custom liquidation cluster detection algorithm (stop-loss order book analysis)
- 1-hour ATR (14-period)
- 5-day average of 1-hour ATR
- Price action confirmation tools (candlestick patterns, volume spikes)

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Backtest different cluster proximity thresholds (0.3%-0.7%)
- Experiment with ATR multiplier for exits (1.2x-2x average)
- Adjust stop placement based on volatility (wider stops in high ATR environments)

This strategy works best in ranging markets and requires careful monitoring of order flow dynamics. The LiquidityReversalTrigger approach combines institutional-level liquidation patterns with retail-friendly volatility measurements for high-probability reversal trades.
