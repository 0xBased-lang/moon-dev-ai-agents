STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on identifying high-probability reversal opportunities at key liquidation zones where stop-loss orders are historically clustered, combined with volatility compression signals.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Zones: Historical price levels where high-frequency stop-loss orders are clustered (typically near swing highs/lows)
2. Volatility Filter: ATR must be below its 20-day average (compression signal)
3. Reversal Confirmation: Price approaching these zones with signs of rejection

Entry Rules:
1. Identify historical liquidation zones (areas where price previously triggered clusters of stop orders)
2. Wait for price to approach these zones while ATR is below its 20-day average
3. Enter short when price shows rejection at upper liquidation zone (bearish reversal patterns, wicks)
4. Enter long when price shows rejection at lower liquidation zone (bullish reversal patterns, wicks)

Exit Rules:
1. For short positions: Take profit at next significant support level or when ATR rises above 20-day average
2. For long positions: Take profit at next significant resistance level or when ATR rises above 20-day average
3. Stop-loss placed just beyond the liquidation zone (allowing for some stop-hunting)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on distance to stop-loss (1-2% risk per trade)
2. Maximum 5% portfolio risk at any time
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause abnormal volatility

Required Indicators:
1. Historical liquidation zone identification (requires analysis of order flow data or historical stop-run areas)
2. 20-day ATR (Average True Range) for volatility compression filter
3. Price action tools for reversal confirmation (candlestick patterns, wicks)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets with clear support/resistance levels
- Less effective during strong trending markets
- Requires careful identification of true liquidation zones (not just random support/resistance)
- Best timeframes: 4H and Daily charts for reliable signals
