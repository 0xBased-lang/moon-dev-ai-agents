STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility expansion signals with trend confirmation to capture strong directional moves, using a multi-timeframe approach for confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Chaikin Volatility (15-min): Measures the rate of price change
2. 24-hour SMA of Chaikin Volatility: Baseline for volatility expansion
3. Supertrend Indicator: Confirms bullish trend direction
4. 2x ATR Trailing Stop: Dynamic exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 15-minute Chaikin Volatility must cross ABOVE its 24-hour SMA
2. Confirmation: Supertrend indicator must simultaneously flip to bullish (green)
3. Execution: Enter long position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: 2x the current ATR (14-period) value
   - Calculated from the highest high since entry
   - Stop moves up as price advances but never moves down
2. Alternative Exit: Supertrend flipping bearish (red) if it occurs before stop is hit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop set at 2x ATR from entry price
3. Volatility Filter: Only trade when ATR(14) > 1.5x its 20-period SMA (avoid low volatility periods)

Required Indicators:
1. Chaikin Volatility (standard settings)
2. Simple Moving Average (24-hour period of Chaikin Volatility)
3. Supertrend (recommended settings: 10-period ATR, 3x multiplier)
4. Average True Range (14-period)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ATR multipliers for trailing stop (1.5x-3x range)
- Experiment with Chaikin Volatility periods (10-30 min)
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy excels in trending markets with expanding volatility, while the multi-factor confirmation helps filter false breakouts. The dynamic exit adapts to market conditions, locking in profits during strong moves while giving trades room to develop.
