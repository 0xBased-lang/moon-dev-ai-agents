STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricVortex

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Volume Profile Analysis: Identifies low-volume nodes (areas of minimal trading activity) which often act as breakout zones
- Vortex Indicator: Confirms trend direction with VI+ (positive) and VI- (negative) crossover signals
- Chande's Kroll Volatility Bands: Used for dynamic trailing stop placement based on market volatility

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for price to approach a identified low-volume node on the volume profile
- Enter long when:
  * Price breaks above the low-volume node
  * VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish confirmation)
- Enter short when:
  * Price breaks below the low-volume node
  * VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish confirmation)

3. Exit Rules:
- Initial stop placed at the opposite side of the low-volume node
- Trailing stop adjusted using Chande's Kroll Volatility Bands:
  * For long positions: trail stop below the lower volatility band
  * For short positions: trail stop above the upper volatility band
- Exit entire position when trailing stop is hit

4. Risk Management:
- Position size calculated based on distance between entry and initial stop
- Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of account
- No new entries if current trade is active (prevents over-trading)

5. Required Indicators:
- Volume Profile (to identify low-volume nodes)
- Vortex Indicator (default 14-period recommended)
- Chande's Kroll Volatility Bands (standard settings: 10-period Average True Range with 3x multiplier)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour charts
- Works well in trending markets, may produce false signals in ranging conditions
- Volume profile should be built using at least 20 trading sessions of data
- Confirm breakouts with increased volume for higher probability trades

This strategy combines volume-based support/resistance levels with momentum confirmation and volatility-adjusted exits, creating a systematic approach to breakout trading.
