STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on short-term mean reversion opportunities
- Identifies clustered liquidation events (likely using order flow or volume analysis)
- Combines statistical deviation from VWAP with liquidation signals
- Uses 20-period Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as baseline
- Standard deviation bands (1σ and 2.5σ) for entry/exit thresholds

2. Entry Rules:
- Trigger when both conditions are met:
  a) Clustered liquidation events detected (likely multiple large orders in short timeframe)
  b) Price reaches 2.5 standard deviations from 20-period VWAP
- Enter position in direction of mean reversion (toward VWAP)

3. Exit Rules:
- Close position when price retraces to 1 standard deviation from VWAP
- Consider additional exit if liquidation cluster dissipates before reaching target

4. Risk Management:
- Natural stop-loss beyond 2.5σ entry point (e.g., 3σ as emergency exit)
- Position sizing should account for volatility (wider stops at extreme deviations)
- Time-based exit if price stagnates without mean reversion

5. Required Indicators:
- 20-period VWAP with standard deviation bands (1σ and 2.5σ)
- Liquidation cluster detection (requires order flow analysis or volume spike indicators)
- Standard deviation calculator (for VWAP bands)

6. Additional Considerations:
- Works best in volatile market conditions
- Requires real-time data feed for liquidation detection
- Most effective on liquid assets with frequent large orders
- May combine with volume profile for additional confirmation
- Timeframe recommendation: 5min to 1hr charts for short-term trades

Note: The strategy assumes clustered liquidations create temporary price distortions that tend to revert toward VWAP. The 2.5σ threshold provides statistical edge while 1σ exit captures majority of reversion move.
