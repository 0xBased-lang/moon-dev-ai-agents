STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when Bollinger Bands contract (squeeze), indicating potential upcoming volatility expansion.  
2. **Liquidation Cluster Analysis:** Uses futures order book data to pinpoint clustered liquidation levels, which act as significant support/resistance zones.  
3. **Volatility Expansion Confirmation:** Requires a breakout from the Bollinger Band squeeze with increased volume or price momentum to confirm the trade.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for a Bollinger Band squeeze (bands narrowing significantly).  
2. Identify nearby liquidation clusters on the order book (high concentration of stop orders).  
3. Enter long/short when price breaks out of the squeeze with strong momentum (e.g., closing outside the bands) and the breakout aligns with a liquidity cluster.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. Take profit at the next major liquidation cluster (predefined level from order book analysis).  
2. Stop-loss placed just beyond the opposite Bollinger Band or the nearest opposing liquidation level.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on the distance to the stop-loss to maintain a fixed risk percentage (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
2. Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to prevent slippage.  
3. Trailing stops can be used if volatility remains high post-breakout.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).  
2. Futures order book liquidity heatmap (to spot liquidation clusters).  
3. Volume indicator (to confirm breakout strength).  

This strategy combines technical (Bollinger Bands) and order flow (liquidation clusters) analysis for high-probability breakout trades. The name "LiquidationSqueeze" reflects its unique focus on exploiting squeezes that align with liquidity-driven price movements.
