STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFractal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on identifying and trading reversal opportunities at key liquidation clusters, combining order book analysis with Fibonacci retracement levels for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Identification:
   - Aggregates historical high-leverage positions data
   - Identifies price levels with significant liquidations
   - Marks these as potential reversal zones

2. Order Book Confirmation:
   - Monitors order book depth in real-time
   - Looks for sudden depletion of liquidity at key levels
   - Confirms potential reversal when depth drops sharply

3. Fibonacci Filter:
   - Uses Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)
   - Only considers trades where liquidation clusters align with key Fib levels
   - Adds confluence to the reversal setup

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price approaches identified liquidation cluster from above
   - Order book shows sudden depth depletion at the level
   - Cluster aligns with Fibonacci support level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%)
   - Enter on first bullish reversal candle after confirmation

2. Short Entry:
   - Price approaches identified liquidation cluster from below
   - Order book shows sudden depth depletion at the level
   - Cluster aligns with Fibonacci resistance level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%)
   - Enter on first bearish reversal candle after confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit:
   - First target at next significant liquidity zone
   - Second target at 1.618 Fibonacci extension of recent swing
   - Consider partial profits at 1:1 risk-reward ratio

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place stop beyond the liquidation cluster
   - Minimum 1.5x the average candle size
   - Adjust based on volatility (ATR can be used)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
4. Adjust position size based on cluster significance

Required Indicators/Tools:
1. Liquidation cluster heatmap (historical leverage data)
2. Real-time order book depth analyzer
3. Fibonacci retracement tool
4. Volume profile (optional for additional confirmation)
5. ATR for stop loss sizing (optional)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in markets with high leverage participation (crypto, forex)
- Most effective on higher timeframes (1H, 4H, Daily)
- Requires monitoring of market sentiment/news for potential catalysts
- Backtest with different Fibonacci levels to find optimal settings
