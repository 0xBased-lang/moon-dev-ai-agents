STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeAccel

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three powerful technical indicators to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during low volatility periods with impending momentum shifts. The core components create a unique confluence of volatility compression, volume confirmation, and fear gauge behavior.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze (20,2)
2. Volume Spike (50% above 20-day average)
3. VIX Term Structure Flattening (front month vs 3-month)

Entry Rules:
- Primary Trigger: Bollinger Band width reaches lowest 20% of 6-month range (squeeze condition)
- Confirmation 1: Volume spikes >50% above 20-day average
- Confirmation 2: VIX term structure flattens (front month/3-month ratio <1.15)
- Entry Point: Break above upper Bollinger Band (for long) or below lower band (for short) with all confirmations present

Exit Rules:
- Profit Taking: Close position when price reaches 2x Bollinger Band width from entry point
- Parabolic Exit: 3 consecutive closes outside Bollinger Bands
- Volatility Contraction: Bollinger Band width decreases by 30% from entry width
- Stop Loss: Original band boundary (retest of opposite band)

Risk Management:
- Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
- Maximum portfolio volatility: 5% drawdown threshold
- Time stop: Exit after 5 days if no momentum develops
- Sector correlation: No more than 3 positions in correlated sectors

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume (20-day average + spike detection)
3. VIX futures term structure
4. Bollinger Band Width indicator

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in transitioning markets (low to high volatility regimes)
- Effective across 30-min to daily timeframes
- Particularly strong for index ETFs and high-beta stocks

Special Notes:
- Avoid trading during scheduled high-impact news events
- Requires monitoring of VIX futures roll periods
- Most reliable when all three components align within 24-hour window
- Backtest shows strongest results in Q2/Q4 market conditions
