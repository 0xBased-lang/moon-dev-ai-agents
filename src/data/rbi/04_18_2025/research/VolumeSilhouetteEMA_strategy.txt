STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeSilhouetteEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumeSilhouetteEMA strategy combines trend confirmation with volume analysis and momentum exhaustion signals for precise entries and exits. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Trend Identification: Uses the golden cross (50EMA > 200EMA) as primary trend confirmation
- Volume Filter: Requires declining volume during the crossover for added confirmation
- Momentum Exit: Relies on RSI overbought levels (70+) to capture profit before potential reversals

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Primary Condition: 50-period EMA must cross above 200-period EMA (golden cross)
- Secondary Filter: Volume must be in a declining trend during the crossover
- Confirmation: Wait for the candle to close above both EMAs after crossover

3. EXIT RULES:
- Profit-taking: Exit when RSI(14) crosses above 70
- Stop-loss: Place below the most recent swing low or 2% below entry (whichever is closer)
- Emergency Exit: Immediate exit if 50EMA crosses back below 200EMA

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Stop placement: Dynamic (swing low based) or fixed percentage (2%)
- Trade frequency: Only trade clear golden crosses with volume confirmation

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Volume indicator (standard or OBV)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI) with 14-period setting

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Test different RSI periods (12-16) for exit sensitivity
- Experiment with volume decline thresholds (e.g., 3 consecutive lower volume bars)
- Consider adding a minimum price distance requirement between EMAs at crossover

7. MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Best suited for trending markets
- Less effective in choppy or range-bound conditions
- Works across multiple timeframes (4H and above recommended)

The unique "VolumeSilhouette" aspect comes from the strategy's reliance on declining volume patterns during the EMA crossover, creating a distinctive setup silhouette on the chart. This volume confirmation helps filter out false breakouts while the RSI exit captures profits before typical pullbacks.
