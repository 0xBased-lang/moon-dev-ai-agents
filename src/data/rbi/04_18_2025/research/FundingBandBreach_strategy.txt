STRATEGY_NAME: FundingBandBreach

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Extremes: Focuses on extreme negative funding rates as a contrarian signal
2. Bollinger Band Breakout: Uses lower Bollinger Band breach as confirmation
3. Mean Reversion Exit: Exits when funding rates normalize to 30-day average

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for funding rate to reach extreme negative level (suggested threshold: bottom 5% of historical distribution)
2. Confirm price has closed below lower Bollinger Band (standard 20-period, 2 std dev)
3. Enter short position when both conditions are met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When current funding rate crosses above its 30-day simple moving average
2. Emergency Exit: If price closes back inside Bollinger Bands while still in extreme funding territory

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance from Bollinger Band (wider breach = smaller position)
2. Suggested stop-loss at 2x Bollinger Band width above entry price
3. Maximum allocation of 5% per trade

Required Indicators:
1. Funding rate data feed (platform-specific)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
3. 30-day simple moving average of funding rates
4. Historical funding rate distribution analysis tool

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different lookback periods for funding rate extremes (30/60/90 days)
2. Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (14/20/26) and deviations (1.5/2/2.5)
3. Consider adding volume confirmation on the breakout
4. May combine with RSI oversold filter for additional confirmation

This strategy combines mean-reversion in funding rates with momentum confirmation via Bollinger Bands, creating a high-probability shorting opportunity during market panic periods.
