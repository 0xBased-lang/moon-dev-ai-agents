STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum shifts with volatility contraction to identify high-probability reversal points. The key components are:

1. INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- 3-day Rate of Change (ROC)
- 10-day Rate of Change (ROC)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation recommended)
- Bollinger Bandwidth (BB width) calculation

2. ENTRY CONDITIONS:
LONG ENTRY:
- Current BB width < 10th percentile of 100-day BB width history
- 3-day ROC crosses ABOVE 10-day ROC
- Price must be in lower 30% of Bollinger Band

SHORT ENTRY:
- Current BB width < 10th percentile of 100-day BB width history
- 3-day ROC crosses BELOW 10-day ROC
- Price must be in upper 30% of Bollinger Band

3. EXIT CONDITIONS:
- Primary exit: When BB width expands beyond 25th percentile of 100-day history
- Secondary exit: When the 3-day ROC crosses back through the 10-day ROC in opposite direction
- Emergency exit: 2% of account stop-loss (or volatility-adjusted equivalent)

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing based on volatility (ATR recommended)
- Maximum 1-2% risk per trade
- No new entries when BB width > 50th percentile
- Avoid trading during major news events

5. FILTERS:
- Volume should be above 20-day average
- Preferably trade with prevailing higher timeframe trend
- Avoid extreme gap openings

6. UNIQUE ASPECTS:
- Combines momentum crossover with volatility extremes
- Uses percentile-based bandwidth thresholds rather than fixed values
- Requires both technical conditions (ROC) and volatility conditions (BB) to align

7. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Test different ROC periods (2/7, 3/10, 5/14 combinations)
- Adjust BB width percentiles based on asset volatility
- Consider adding RSI filter for overbought/oversold conditions

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, and should be avoided during strong, established trends where volatility remains elevated.
