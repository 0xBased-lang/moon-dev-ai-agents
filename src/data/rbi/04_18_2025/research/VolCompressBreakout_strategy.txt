STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Breakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Compression Detection:** Uses Bollinger Bands width to identify periods of extreme low volatility (6-month lows), signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires RSI to cross above 50 to validate the entry, ensuring momentum aligns with the volatility expansion.  
3. **Dynamic Exit:** Exits positions when Bollinger Bands width exceeds 2x the entry value, capturing the volatility expansion phase.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev) width reaches a 6-month low (measured by the lowest width value in the past 126 trading days).  
- **Condition 2:** RSI (14-period) crosses above 50, confirming upward momentum.  
- **Action:** Enter a long position at the next candle's open after both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** Bollinger Bands width exceeds 2x the width value at the time of entry.  
- **Secondary Exit (Optional):** Trailing stop or fixed profit target (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio) to lock in gains if volatility expands slowly.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop below the recent swing low or use a volatility-based stop (e.g., 1.5x ATR).  
- **Avoid Overexposure:** Limit concurrent trades to 3-5 positions to diversify across instruments.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2 Std Dev)** – To measure volatility compression/expansion.  
2. **RSI (14-period)** – For momentum confirmation.  
3. **ATR (14-period, optional)** – For dynamic stop placement.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends; avoid during high-volatility regimes.  
- Backtest on multiple asset classes (stocks, forex, commodities) to ensure robustness.  
- Adjust the RSI period or Bollinger Bands settings for shorter/longer timeframes.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility extremes with momentum, reducing false breakouts common in traditional Bollinger Band strategies.
