STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityQuotient  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Entry:** The strategy focuses on identifying low-volatility periods by comparing the 10-day historical volatility to its 20-day moving average.  
2. **RSI-Based Exit:** Exits are triggered when the 5-day RSI indicates overbought conditions, ensuring timely profit-taking.  
3. **Mean-Reversion Implication:** The strategy implicitly assumes that low volatility periods are followed by mean-reverting price movements.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Enter a long position when the 10-day historical volatility (HV) falls below its 20-day moving average (MA).  
  - Formula: `HV(10) < MA(HV(20))`  
  - This signals a contraction in volatility, often preceding a breakout or mean-reversion move.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Condition:** Close the long position when the 5-day RSI crosses above 70.  
  - Formula: `RSI(5) > 70`  
  - This indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal or pullback.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Optional but recommendedâ€”set a stop-loss at a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below the entry price or use a trailing stop based on recent volatility.  
2. **Position Sizing:** Allocate capital based on the volatility of the asset (e.g., higher volatility = smaller position size).  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** If the trade remains open for an extended period (e.g., 10 days) without triggering the RSI exit, consider closing it to avoid stagnation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **10-Day Historical Volatility (HV):** Measures the standard deviation of daily price changes over 10 days.  
2. **20-Day Moving Average of HV:** Smoothes the volatility data to identify trends in volatility.  
3. **5-Day RSI:** A short-term momentum oscillator to detect overbought conditions.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or mildly trending markets.  
- Avoid using during high-volatility regimes (e.g., earnings season, macroeconomic events).  
- Backtest across multiple asset classes to confirm robustness.  

This strategy combines volatility contraction with short-term momentum, making it unique as "VolatilityQuotient." The name reflects its focus on volatility metrics (Quotient) and their predictive power for mean-reverting moves.
