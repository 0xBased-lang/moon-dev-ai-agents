STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeTrail  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies low volatility periods when the Bollinger Band width (20-day, 2σ) contracts below 2%, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** Requires volume to surge 50% above the 20-day average to validate the breakout and filter false signals.  
3. **Trailing Stop Exit:** Uses a dynamic 3x ATR (Average True Range) trailing stop to lock in profits and manage risk during volatile moves.  
4. **Symmetrical Short Setup:** Applies inverse logic for short entries when Bollinger Band width contracts and volume surges downward.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - Bollinger Band width (20-day, 2σ) contracts below 2%.  
  - Volume exceeds the 20-day average by 50%.  
- **Short Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - Bollinger Band width contracts below 2%.  
  - Volume drops 50% below the 20-day average (or inversely, surges on price decline).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit positions when price reverses by 3x the current ATR (14-period) from the highest high (long) or lowest low (short).  
- **Optional Time Exit:** Close trades after a fixed period (e.g., 10 bars) if the trailing stop isn’t hit.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Placement:** Initial stop set at 2x ATR from entry to avoid premature exits.  
3. **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if ATR exceeds 5% of the asset’s price (adjustable threshold).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2σ)** – To measure band width contraction.  
2. **Volume (20-day MA)** – To confirm breakout strength.  
3. **ATR (14-period)** – For trailing stop and risk calculation.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with volume confirmation and aggressive trail management, targeting explosive moves while minimizing whipsaw risk.
