STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaVWAP  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Adjusted VWAP Bands**: Uses a rolling 24-hour Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as the mean reference, with dynamic bands set at ±2x the Average True Range (ATR) to account for volatility.  
2. **Mean-Reversion Focus**: Aims to capitalize on price deviations beyond the VWAP bands, assuming reversion to the mean.  
3. **Dynamic Exit Mechanism**: Exits trades when price returns inside the bands or via a trailing stop scaled by volatility (ATR).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when price closes **below** the lower band (VWAP - 2x ATR).  
- **Short Entry**: Triggered when price closes **above** the upper band (VWAP + 2x ATR).  
- **Confirmation**: Optional filter (e.g., RSI < 30 for longs, RSI > 70 for shorts) to avoid false signals in strong trends.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Primary Exit**: Close position when price crosses back **inside** the VWAP bands (e.g., long exits when price > VWAP - 2x ATR).  
2. **Trailing Stop**: Adjusts stop-loss dynamically using ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR from recent extreme).  
3. **Time-Based Exit**: Optional 24-hour hold period to align with VWAP recalibration.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Scale based on ATR (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade, stop distance = 2x ATR).  
- **Stop-Loss**: Initial stop at ±3x ATR from entry for outlier protection.  
- **Volatility Filter**: Pause trading if ATR exceeds 5% of price (extreme volatility).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **24-Hour Rolling VWAP** (recalculated hourly).  
2. **ATR (14-period)** for band width and stop calculations.  
3. **Optional**: RSI (14-period) for trend confirmation.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- **Volatility Scaling**: Bands and stops adapt to market conditions via ATR.  
- **Time-Sensitive Mean**: 24-hour VWAP ensures relevance to recent price action.  
- **Asymmetric Exits**: Combines mean-reversion (band re-entry) and trend-following (trailing stop) logic.  

**Note**: Works best in ranging markets; avoid during strong trends (use RSI filter if added).
