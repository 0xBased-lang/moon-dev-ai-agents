STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreach  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Breakout:** The strategy focuses on price breaching the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential upward momentum.  
2. **Volatility Squeeze:** A volatility squeeze is identified when the Bollinger Band bandwidth (difference between upper and lower bands) is at its narrowest over a 10-day period, signaling low volatility and potential for a breakout.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Rising volume is required to confirm the breakout, ensuring the move is supported by increased trading activity.  
4. **Exit Conditions:** The trade is exited when price touches the lower Bollinger Band (indicating potential reversal or weakening momentum) or when volume drops below its 10-day average (loss of confirmation).  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Volatility Squeeze Condition:** The Bollinger Band bandwidth must be at its narrowest over the past 10 days.  
2. **Price Action:** Price must breach the upper Bollinger Band.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Volume must be rising (e.g., higher than previous dayâ€™s volume or above a short-term average).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Lower Band Touch:** Exit the trade when price touches the lower Bollinger Band.  
2. **Volume Drop:** Exit if volume falls below the 10-day average volume.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Consider placing a stop-loss just below a recent swing low or a key support level to limit downside risk.  
2. **Position Sizing:** Allocate a conservative portion of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2% of portfolio) to manage risk during volatile breakouts.  
3. **Avoid Overcrowded Conditions:** Be cautious of false breakouts during low-liquidity periods or major news events.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Standard settings (20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations).  
2. **Bandwidth Calculation:** (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band (SMA), measured over 10 days to identify the squeeze.  
3. **Volume Indicator:** 10-day average volume for confirmation and exit signals.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets but may produce false signals in choppy or sideways conditions.  
- Backtest on multiple assets/timeframes to validate robustness.  
- Combine with additional filters (e.g., RSI not overbought) to improve accuracy.
