STRATEGY_NAME: KeltnerWilliams Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines mean-reversion signals from Williams %R with trend-confirmation from Keltner Channels, creating a unique breakout approach with defined risk management.

Key Components:
1. Williams %R (3-day): Identifies oversold conditions when crossing above -80
2. Keltner Channel (20-period): Confirms breakout momentum when price breaks upper band
3. Bollinger Band: Serves as profit target (upper band)
4. Trailing Stop (5%): Secondary exit mechanism for risk control

Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: 3-day Williams %R crosses above -80 (oversold signal)
- Confirmation: Price simultaneously breaks above upper 20-period Keltner Channel
- Both conditions must occur on same candle for valid entry

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Exit when price touches upper Bollinger Band
2. Protective Stop: 5% trailing stop (adjusts with price movement)
3. Whichever condition triggers first executes the exit

Risk Management:
- Position sizing should maintain risk below 2% of capital per trade
- Stop loss is dynamic (5% trailing) but initial risk is distance from entry to 5% below entry price
- No trades if volatility (BB width) exceeds 3x average

Required Indicators:
1. Williams %R (3-day period)
2. Keltner Channel (20-period, default settings)
3. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
4. Price chart with all three indicators displayed

Optimization Notes:
- Test different Williams %R periods (2-5 days)
- Experiment with Keltner Channel lengths (15-25 periods)
- Adjust trailing stop percentage (3-7%) based on volatility
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy works best in ranging markets with clear support/resistance levels, combining oversold reversal signals with momentum confirmation for higher-probability trades.
