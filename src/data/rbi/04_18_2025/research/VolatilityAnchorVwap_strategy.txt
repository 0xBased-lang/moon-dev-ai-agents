STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityAnchorVwap

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume spikes, and anchored VWAP to identify high-probability breakout or mean-reversion opportunities. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Key Components:
1. Volatility Filter: Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2) must be below its 50th percentile over a 3-day period
2. Volume Trigger: Sudden 200%+ increase in volume compared to 20-day average
3. Anchored VWAP: Calculated from the volume spike candle as the anchor point

Entry Rules:
1. Breakout Entry:
- When price breaks above the anchored VWAP with confirmation candle close
- Only valid if breakout occurs within 3 candles of the volume spike
- Volume on breakout should be at least 150% of 20-day average

2. Mean-Reversion Entry:
- When price pulls back to anchored VWAP after initial spike
- Requires RSI(14) between 30-70 for confirmation
- Must occur within 5 candles of the volume spike

Exit Rules:
1. For Breakout Trades:
- Take profit at 1.5x average true range (ATR14) from entry
- Stop loss at 0.75x ATR14 below anchored VWAP
- Trail stop after 1x ATR profit is reached

2. For Mean-Reversion Trades:
- Take profit at 1x ATR14 from entry
- Stop loss at 1.5x ATR14 beyond anchored VWAP
- Close position if price doesn't reverse within 3 candles

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. No more than 3 concurrent positions
3. Daily loss limit of 5% total capital
4. Weekly drawdown limit of 10%

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) for bandwidth calculation
2. Volume 20-day moving average
3. Anchored VWAP (from spike candle)
4. RSI (14 periods)
5. ATR (14 periods)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
- Works well with liquid stocks/forex pairs
- Requires manual confirmation of volume spike quality
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Backtest suggested for optimal ATR multiples
