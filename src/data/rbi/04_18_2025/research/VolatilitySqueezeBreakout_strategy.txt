STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction, volume analysis, and anchored VWAP to identify high-probability breakout trades during periods of compressed volatility.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures when volatility falls below historical norms
2. Volume Surge Filter: Confirms breakout validity with increased participation
3. Anchored VWAP: Provides dynamic profit target based on consolidation period

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width (Upper Band - Lower Band) to contract below its 20th percentile of historical values (suggesting extreme compression)
2. Monitor for price breaking above resistance or below support with:
   - Volume exceeding 20-day average by at least 50%
   - Breakout candle closing beyond the Bollinger Band boundary
3. Enter long on breakout above resistance or short on breakdown below support

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Anchored VWAP from the start of consolidation period
   - For long trades: Take profit at anchored VWAP + 1 standard deviation
   - For short trades: Take profit at anchored VWAP - 1 standard deviation
2. Stop Loss:
   - Place below recent swing low (for longs) or above recent swing high (for shorts)
   - Alternative: Use opposite Bollinger Band as dynamic stop

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio required
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Maximum 5% portfolio exposure to any single sector

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator
3. Volume 20-day moving average
4. Anchored VWAP (set from start of consolidation)
5. Historical volatility percentile calculator

Optimization Tips:
1. Backtest different percentile thresholds (15th-25th) for Bollinger Band contraction
2. Experiment with volume surge multipliers (40-60% above average)
3. Test various VWAP standard deviation targets (0.5-1.5 SD)
4. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., only trade breakouts when RSI is between 30-70)

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using volatility compression as a springboard for directional moves confirmed by volume expansion. The anchored VWAP provides an objective profit target based on the consolidation period's value area.
