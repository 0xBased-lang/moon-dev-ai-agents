STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This sophisticated mean reversion strategy combines volatility analysis with volume-weighted price action, creating high-probability entries at extreme deviations while using Bollinger Band dynamics for confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted Moving Average (20-period)
2. Standard Deviation Channels (2.5σ and 1σ)
3. Bollinger Band Width indicator
4. Mean reversion logic with volatility filters

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Price must breach 2.5 standard deviations from the 20-period VWMA
2. Confirmation: Bollinger Band width must be narrowing (decreasing) on the same timeframe
3. Volume Context: Entry is stronger when accompanied by above-average volume

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Exit when price returns to 1 standard deviation from VWMA
2. Emergency Stop: 3σ level acts as ultimate stop-loss
3. Time Exit: Close position if Bollinger Band width begins expanding before target hit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance between entry and 3σ stop level
2. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Daily loss limit: 5% of account

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted Moving Average (20 periods)
2. Standard Deviation Channels (1σ, 2.5σ, and 3σ levels)
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation
4. Volume indicator (for confirmation)

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust standard deviation multipliers based on asset volatility (2.0-3.0σ range)
2. Test different VWMA periods (15-30) for various instruments
3. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., only trade reversions when RSI is extreme)

This "VoltaicReversion" strategy excels in ranging markets with strong mean-reverting tendencies, using volume-weighting to identify significant deviations and Bollinger dynamics to confirm the reversal potential. The combination of statistical extremes with volatility contraction creates high-probability setups while maintaining strict risk controls.
