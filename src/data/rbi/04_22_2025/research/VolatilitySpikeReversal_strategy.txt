STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySpikeReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme volatility events combined with derivatives market sentiment to identify high-probability mean reversion opportunities. The approach combines statistical volatility measurements with funding rate dynamics and channel-based exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses 3-standard deviation moves from a 20-period rolling standard deviation
2. Sentiment Indicator: Monitors perpetual futures funding rates for extreme spikes
3. Exit Mechanism: Keltner Channel (20-period EMA with 2.5x ATR bands) upper band as profit target

Entry Rules:
1. Price must drop at least 3 standard deviations below its 20-period mean
2. Concurrent spike in perpetual funding rates (minimum 0.1% daily rate)
3. Entry occurs at the first 15-minute candle close meeting both conditions

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price touches or crosses the upper Keltner Channel band
2. Emergency Exit: If price drops further to 4 standard deviations below mean
3. Time Exit: After 48 hours if neither target nor stop is hit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk of account per trade
2. Stop loss placed at 4 standard deviations below entry point
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% across all positions

Required Indicators:
1. Standard Deviation (20-period)
2. Perpetual Funding Rate monitor
3. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2.5x 20-period ATR)
4. Simple Moving Average (20-period for mean calculation)

Optimization Notes:
- Best performance observed in high-liquidity crypto pairs (BTC, ETH)
- Ideal timeframe: 15-minute to 4-hour charts
- Requires monitoring during high volatility periods
- Most effective when funding rate spike persists for at least 2 consecutive periods

This strategy combines statistical extremes with derivatives market dynamics, creating a robust framework for capturing overextended moves while maintaining disciplined risk parameters. The unique pairing of spot price volatility with derivatives sentiment provides an edge in identifying high-probability reversal setups.
