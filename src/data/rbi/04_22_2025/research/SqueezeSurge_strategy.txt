STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze (20-day, 2σ):** Identifies periods of low volatility, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Volume Surge (200% above 30-day average):** Confirms breakout validity with a significant increase in trading activity.  
3. **VWAP Crossover:** Ensures price momentum aligns with the breakout direction (price crossing above/below VWAP).  
4. **Stochastic RSI (Overbought/Oversold):** Provides exit signals when momentum extremes are reached.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands are in a squeeze (width at multi-day lows).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume surges to at least 200% of the 30-day average.  
  4. Price crosses above VWAP.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands are in a squeeze (width at multi-day lows).  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume surges to at least 200% of the 30-day average.  
  4. Price crosses below VWAP.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - Stochastic RSI (14,3,3) crosses below 80 (overbought).  
  - Or if price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands.  

- **Short Exit:**  
  - Stochastic RSI (14,3,3) crosses above 20 (oversold).  
  - Or if price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Place stop-loss at the midpoint of the Bollinger Bands (20-day SMA) for long trades.  
  - Place stop-loss at the midpoint of the Bollinger Bands (20-day SMA) for short trades.  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-day, 2σ).  
2. Volume (30-day average comparison).  
3. VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price).  
4. Stochastic RSI (14,3,3).  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to ensure volume surge validity.  
- Backtest for optimal Stochastic RSI thresholds based on asset volatility.
