STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityConvergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **VWAP Convergence-Divergence:** The strategy uses Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) to identify potential breakout points. A bullish signal occurs when price breaks above VWAP, indicating upward momentum.  
2. **Bollinger Bandwidth Percentile:** Measures the historical volatility range. The strategy triggers only when the bandwidth is in its lowest 10% percentile, suggesting a period of extreme compression before a potential breakout.  
3. **ATR-Based Exit:** The exit is determined by a 2x multiple of the daily Average True Range (ATR), ensuring a volatility-adjusted profit-taking mechanism.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Bandwidth percentile must be ≤ 10% (indicating low volatility).  
- **Condition 2:** Price must break above VWAP (confirmation of bullish momentum).  
- **Entry Action:** Go long at the breakout candle’s close or next open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit when price reaches 2x the daily ATR from the entry point.  
- **Stop-Loss:** A trailing or fixed stop can be applied (e.g., 1x ATR below entry for risk control).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with volatility (e.g., risk ≤ 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid entering during high-impact news events that may distort VWAP and bandwidth readings.  
- Monitor for false breakouts—if price fails to sustain above VWAP, consider early exit.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price)  
2. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 Std Dev) + Bandwidth calculation:  
   - Bandwidth = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band  
   - Percentile rank over a lookback period (e.g., 100 days).  
3. **Daily ATR** (14-period) for exit targeting.  

**Notes:**  
- Best suited for liquid assets with clear volatility cycles (e.g., indices, large-cap stocks).  
- Backtest to optimize bandwidth percentile threshold and ATR multiplier.  
- Combine with volume confirmation to filter higher-probability breakouts.
