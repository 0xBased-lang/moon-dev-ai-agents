STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiVolt Squeeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme volatility contractions during periods of concentrated liquidation activity, combining Bollinger Band analysis with liquidation cluster detection for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - Measures volatility contraction when near yearly lows
2. Liquidation Cluster Zones - Identifies price levels with high liquidity concentrations
3. ATR Trailing Stop - Dynamic exit mechanism for volatility expansion phases

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: BBW must be at/near its lowest 5% of yearly range (extreme contraction)
2. Secondary Condition: Price must be trading within a pre-identified liquidation cluster zone
3. Confirmation: Wait for price to touch the Bollinger Band (upper for short, lower for long)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: ATR-based trailing stop (suggested 2.5-3x current ATR)
2. Secondary Exit: BBW expansion beyond contraction threshold (e.g., above 20th percentile)
3. Emergency Exit: Price exits liquidation cluster zone against position

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance to liquidation cluster boundaries
2. Hard stop at opposite side of liquidation zone
3. Volatility-adjusted position sizing (reduce size during higher baseline ATR)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation)
2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) indicator
3. ATR (14-period recommended)
4. Liquidation heatmap/cluster indicator (or volume profile analysis)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets with clear liquidity pools
- Avoid during strong trending markets without consolidation
- Most effective on 4H/daily timeframes for cleaner signals

Note: Requires continuous monitoring of liquidity conditions and yearly volatility ranges for proper calibration. Backtest suggested to determine optimal BBW threshold and ATR multiplier for specific instruments.
