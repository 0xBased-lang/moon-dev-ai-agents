STRATEGY_NAME: DualBreakoutVolume  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Moving Averages:** Utilizes both a 20-day and 50-day moving average (MA) to confirm trend alignment.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires trading volume to exceed its 10-day average, ensuring strong participation in the breakout.  
3. **Risk-Reward Management:** Exits trades at a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio, prioritizing disciplined profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when price closes **above both the 20-day and 50-day MA** *and* volume is **higher than the 10-day average volume**.  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when price closes **below both the 20-day and 50-day MA** *and* volume is **higher than the 10-day average volume**.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Set at **2x the initial risk** (e.g., if stop loss is 50 pips, take profit is 100 pips).  
- **Stop Loss:** Placed at the **recent swing low (for long)** or **recent swing high (for short)** beyond the breakout candle.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size is calculated to risk **1-2% of capital per trade**.  
- Trades are invalidated if volume fails to sustain above the 10-day average post-entry.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)  
2. 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)  
3. 10-day Average Volume (rolling calculation)  

**Unique Edge:** The dual MA filter reduces false breakouts, while volume confirmation adds conviction. The fixed risk-reward ratio ensures consistency.  

**Note:** Works best in trending markets; avoid ranging conditions (use ADX >25 to filter).
