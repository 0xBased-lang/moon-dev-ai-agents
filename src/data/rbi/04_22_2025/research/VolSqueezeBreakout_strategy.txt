STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Contraction:** The strategy focuses on periods when the 20-period Bollinger Band width contracts to its lowest 10% of historical values, indicating a potential breakout setup.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** A volume spike above the 30-day average is required to confirm the breakout, ensuring strong participation.  
3. **Reward-Risk Management:** Trades are exited based on a fixed 2:1 reward-risk ratio, ensuring disciplined profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The 20-period Bollinger Band width must be in its lowest 10% of historical values (indicating a squeeze).  
- **Condition 2:** Volume must spike above its 30-day moving average (confirming breakout momentum).  
- **Entry Signal:** Enter long on a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band or short on a breakdown below the lower Bollinger Band, depending on the direction of the breakout.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit the trade when the price reaches a 2:1 reward-risk ratio (e.g., if the stop-loss is 1%, take profit at 2%).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss just below the breakout point (for longs) or above the breakdown point (for shorts).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be adjusted to ensure the stop-loss does not exceed a predefined risk percentage (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or major news events to reduce slippage risk.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – To identify the squeeze condition.  
2. **Volume (30-day moving average)** – To confirm breakout strength.  
3. **Historical Bollinger Band Width Percentile (10th percentile filter)** – To detect extreme contractions.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets but may produce false signals in choppy or range-bound conditions.  
- Backtesting should be done to validate the historical performance of the 10% width threshold for the given asset.  
- Consider combining with additional filters (e.g., RSI divergence or moving average alignment) to improve accuracy.
