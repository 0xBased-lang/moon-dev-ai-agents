STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme volatility expansions by combining Bollinger Band width analysis with volume confirmation for high-probability breakout trades.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) - Measures relative volatility expansion
2. Volume Spike Confirmation - Validates breakout momentum
3. 20-day BB Width Average - Defines exit conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: BB Width Percentile crosses above 90th percentile (extreme volatility expansion)
2. Confirmation: Volume must spike above its 20-day average by at least 50%
3. Entry Point: Next candle's open after both conditions are met
4. Direction: Trade in the direction of the initial breakout candle

Exit Rules:
1. Main Exit: When BB Width contracts below its 20-day simple moving average
2. Optional Stop: 2x ATR (14-period) from entry point for risk management
3. Time Exit: Close position after 5 days if not exited by other rules

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Either 2x ATR or key support/resistance level
3. Maximum Drawdown: 5% of account per week

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. BB Width Percentile (90th percentile threshold)
3. Volume (20-day average + 50% spike filter)
4. ATR (14-period for stop calculation)

Special Notes:
- Works best on liquid assets with natural volatility cycles
- Avoid trading during major news events that may distort volatility readings
- Most effective on daily or 4-hour timeframes
- Requires backtesting to optimize percentile thresholds for specific instruments

This strategy combines the statistical edge of extreme volatility readings with volume confirmation to identify high-momentum breakout opportunities while using volatility contraction as the primary exit signal.
