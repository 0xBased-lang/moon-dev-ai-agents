STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Breakout:** The strategy focuses on price breaking above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential surge in volatility and upward momentum.  
2. **ADX Confirmation:** The ADX (Average Directional Index) must be above 25 to confirm a strong trend, ensuring the breakout has directional strength.  
3. **Volume Surge:** Volume must be at least 20% above its 30-day average, validating the breakout with increased participation.  
4. **Risk-Reward Management:** Exits are based on a 2:1 risk-reward ratio, ensuring disciplined profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  1. Price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  2. ADX is above 25 (confirming trend strength).  
  3. Volume is at least 20% higher than the 30-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Set a stop-loss at the lower Bollinger Band or a recent swing low (whichever is closer).  
- Take profit at a 2:1 risk-reward ratio relative to the stop-loss distance.  
- Optional: Trail the stop-loss to the lower Bollinger Band as the trade progresses to lock in profits.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be calculated based on the stop-loss distance to ensure no more than 1-2% of the account is risked per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – Identifies volatility and potential breakout levels.  
2. **ADX (14-period)** – Confirms trend strength (must be >25).  
3. **Volume (30-day average)** – Filters for high-participation breakouts.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals in choppy or range-bound conditions.  
- Backtesting and optimization of parameters (e.g., ADX threshold, volume filter) are recommended for different asset classes.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend analysis for improved accuracy.
