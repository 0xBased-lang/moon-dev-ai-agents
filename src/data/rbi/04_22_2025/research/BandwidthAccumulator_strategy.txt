STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthAccumulator

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandwidthAccumulator strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction patterns with volume accumulation signals for high-probability breakout trades. This approach focuses on periods of low volatility (as measured by Bollinger Band width) that coincide with underlying accumulation activity.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Analysis (20-period)
   - Measures the contraction of volatility
   - Width must contract below a historical percentile (typically 20th percentile)
   
2. Klinger Volume Oscillator
   - Must show positive values indicating accumulation
   - Confirms underlying buying pressure during the contraction phase

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger:
   - Bollinger Band width contracts below historical low percentile threshold
   - Price must be trading within the bands (not outside)

2. Confirmation:
   - Klinger Volume Oscillator must be positive (above zero line)
   - Recent upward slope preferred for additional confirmation

3. Execution:
   - Enter long on breakout above upper band
   - Enter short on breakdown below lower band
   - Requires closing price confirmation outside the band

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Trailing stop based on opposite band edge
   - Alternative: Fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop placed at opposite band edge
   - For long positions: lower band edge
   - For short positions: upper band edge

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Standard 1-2% risk per trade
   - Adjust stop distance to maintain consistent risk

2. Volatility Filter:
   - Avoid trading if average true range is excessively high
   - Ensures stops aren't too wide for account size

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
   - Standard deviation setting may be adjusted for different instruments
   - Must calculate band width (upper band - lower band)

2. Klinger Volume Oscillator (default settings typically 34,55,13)
   - Must be properly configured for the trading timeframe

3. Historical Percentile Calculator (for band width)
   - Requires lookback period (typically 100-200 periods)

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- Requires sufficient historical data for percentile calculations
- Performs well in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Less effective during strong, established trends where bands remain wide
