STRATEGY_NAME: VortexBandTrail

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands, Vortex Indicator, volume analysis, and ATR-based trailing stops for a systematic mean-reversion approach with momentum confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies potential oversold conditions at lower band
2. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-) - Confirms positive momentum shift
3. Volume Filter - Ensures above-average participation
4. 4-hour ATR (14) - Sets dynamic trailing stop levels

Entry Rules:
1. Price must touch or penetrate the lower Bollinger Band
2. VI+ must cross above VI- simultaneously
3. Current volume must exceed 20-period volume SMA
4. All conditions must occur within the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit: Trailing stop-loss at 2x 4-hour ATR (14-period)
2. Optional exit: When VI+ crosses back below VI- (early warning)
3. Emergency exit: If price touches upper Bollinger Band (contrarian signal)

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop placed at 2x 4-hour ATR below entry
2. Position size calculated as 1% risk per trade
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Maximum 5 open positions simultaneously

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 std dev)
2. Vortex Indicator (default 14 periods)
3. Volume SMA (20 periods)
4. ATR (14 periods on 4h timeframe)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different Bollinger Band periods (14-26)
2. Experiment with ATR multipliers (1.5x-3x)
3. Adjust volume filter sensitivity (15-25 period SMA)
4. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., RSI < 40) for additional confirmation

This strategy works best in ranging markets and requires strict discipline to avoid trading during strong trends where Bollinger Band touches may indicate continuation rather than reversal.
