STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines price breakout dynamics with volume confirmation to identify high-probability trading opportunities. The system requires multiple confirmations before entering trades, reducing false breakouts through its layered approach.

Key Components:
1. Price Breakout Component:
   - 20-day high/low serves as the primary breakout level
   - 3-day EMA acts as a short-term momentum filter

2. Volume Confirmation:
   - Requires volume spike exceeding 30-day average volume by 50%
   - Ensures institutional participation in the breakout

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Price must close above the 20-day high
2. Price must simultaneously be above the 3-day EMA
3. Current volume must exceed 30-day average volume by 50%
4. All conditions must be met on the same candle

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Price must close below the 20-day low
2. Price must simultaneously be below the 3-day EMA
3. Current volume must exceed 30-day average volume by 50%
4. All conditions must be met on the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: Exit when price crosses back through the 3-day EMA
2. Time-based Exit: Close position after 5 days if not stopped out
3. Profit Target: Optional 2:1 risk-reward ratio can be applied

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop at recent swing low (long) or swing high (short)
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. 20-day high/low (price channel)
2. 3-day Exponential Moving Average
3. 30-day average volume
4. Current volume (for spike comparison)

Optimization Notes:
- The 20-day period can be adjusted between 15-25 days based on market volatility
- Volume spike threshold can be tuned between 40-60% depending on the asset
- EMA period can be tested between 2-5 days for optimal filtering

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals during ranging conditions. Traders should avoid using it during low-volume periods or major economic events that may distort normal volume patterns.
