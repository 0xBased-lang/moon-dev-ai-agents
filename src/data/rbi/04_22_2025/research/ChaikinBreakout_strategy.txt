STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Breakout Trigger:** The strategy identifies breakouts when price crosses either the 20-day high (for long entries) or the 20-day low (for short entries).  
2. **Confirmation Filter:** The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator must confirm the breakout with a 3-day streak in the same direction (positive streak for long entries, negative streak for short entries).  
3. **Exit Condition:** Positions are closed when price reverts to the 5-day rolling mean, signaling a potential loss of momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Price crosses above the 20-day high.  
  - CMF has been positive for at least 3 consecutive days.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Price crosses below the 20-day low.  
  - CMF has been negative for at least 3 consecutive days.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Price crosses below the 5-day rolling mean.  
- **Short Exit:** Price crosses above the 5-day rolling mean.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a stop-loss order at a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below the entry price for long positions or above the entry price for short positions.  
- Adjust position sizing based on account risk tolerance (e.g., risking no more than 1-2% of capital per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **20-day High/Low:** Track the highest and lowest prices over the past 20 days.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** A volume-weighted momentum indicator to confirm the strength of the breakout.  
3. **5-day Rolling Mean:** A simple moving average of the closing prices over the past 5 days, used for exit signals.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy combines breakout momentum with volume confirmation (via CMF) to filter false breakouts.  
- The 5-day mean reversion exit ensures timely exits before potential reversals.  
- Works best in trending markets; may underperform in choppy or range-bound conditions.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different CMF streak lengths (e.g., 2-4 days) for confirmation.  
- Experiment with alternative exit conditions, such as a trailing stop or volatility-based stop.  
- Consider adding a trend filter (e.g., 50-day SMA) to avoid counter-trend breakouts.
