STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Filter:** 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to identify the prevailing trend direction.  
2. **Breakout Condition:** Price must cross the 50 EMA (either above for long or below for short).  
3. **Volatility Filter:** Bollinger Band width must be at a 6-month low, indicating a period of low volatility and potential for an explosive breakout.  
4. **Exit Mechanism:** 2x Average True Range (ATR) trailing stop to lock in profits and manage risk dynamically.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Price closes above the 50 EMA.  
  - Bollinger Band width is at its lowest level in the past 6 months (confirming a volatility squeeze).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Price closes below the 50 EMA.  
  - Bollinger Band width is at its lowest level in the past 6 months.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Set a trailing stop at 2x the current ATR value.  
  - For long positions, the stop moves up with price but never down.  
  - For short positions, the stop moves down with price but never up.  
- **Optional Exit:** Consider taking partial profits at 1x ATR and letting the remainder run with the trailing stop.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop Loss:** Initial stop can be placed at 1x ATR from entry if tighter risk control is desired.  
- **Avoid Over-Trading:** Only take signals when the Bollinger Band width confirms a 6-month low (high-probability setup).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period EMA** (Trend filter).  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – Specifically, the width calculation: (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)** – For trailing stop and volatility measurement.  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy thrives in ranging markets transitioning into trends.  
- Backtest to confirm optimal parameters for your trading instrument (e.g., adjusting EMA period or ATR multiplier).  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for additional confirmation.  

**Why "BandwidthBreakout"?**  
- "Bandwidth" reflects the Bollinger Band width volatility squeeze, the core setup filter.  
- "Breakout" emphasizes the EMA-cross trigger, making it distinct from generic breakout strategies.
