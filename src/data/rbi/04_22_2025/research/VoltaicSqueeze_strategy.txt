STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility (squeeze) when the bands narrow significantly, often preceding explosive price movements.  
2. **VWAP Deviation:** Measures how far price is from the Volume-Weighted Average Price, confirming breakout strength when price moves away from VWAP.  
3. **Declining Volume:** During the squeeze, volume typically decreases, and a surge in volume confirms breakout validity.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Squeeze Condition:** Bollinger Band width (upper - lower) must be below a threshold (e.g., 20-period SMA of width).  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Price must close outside the Bollinger Bands (upper for long, lower for short).  
3. **Volume Surge:** Volume on breakout must be significantly higher than recent average (e.g., 1.5x 10-period SMA).  
4. **VWAP Alignment:** For long entries, price should break above VWAP; for short entries, below VWAP.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) or Bollinger Band reversion (closing back inside bands).  
2. **Stop Loss:** Placed at the opposite band or recent swing low/high.  
3. **Time Exit:** If no significant movement occurs within X bars (e.g., 5-10), exit the trade.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position size capped at 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. Stop loss must be respectedâ€”no discretionary holding beyond it.  
3. Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)  
2. VWAP (daily anchor)  
3. Volume (10-period SMA for comparison)  
4. Bollinger Band Width (custom calculation: upper - lower)  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression, volume confirmation, and VWAP alignment to filter high-probability breakouts while avoiding false signals. Works best on 15m-1H timeframes in trending markets.
