STRATEGY_NAME: VortexCyclone

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VortexCyclone strategy combines trend confirmation from the Vortex Indicator (VI) with cycle reversal signals from the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) to identify high-probability trade setups. This approach captures trending moves at optimal cyclical turning points while managing risk through clear confirmation signals.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) - Uses VI+ and VI- lines to determine trend direction and strength
2. Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) - Identifies cyclical extremes and mean reversion opportunities
3. Confirmation Logic - Requires both indicators to align before entering trades

Entry Rules (Long):
1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation)
2. DPO crosses above its lower threshold (typically -1.5 to -2.0 standard deviations)
3. Both signals occur within 1-3 bars of each other

Entry Rules (Short):
1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation)
2. DPO crosses below its upper threshold (typically +1.5 to +2.0 standard deviations)
3. Both signals occur within 1-3 bars of each other

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: VI- crosses above VI+ OR DPO crosses above +1.0 standard deviation
2. For short positions: VI+ crosses above VI- OR DPO crosses below -1.0 standard deviation

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop placed at recent swing low/high beyond DPO extreme
2. Position size calculated using 1-2% risk per trade
3. Trailing stop can be implemented using VI crossovers
4. Maximum trade duration of 5-10 bars to avoid late-cycle entries

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (standard 14-period setting recommended)
2. Detrended Price Oscillator (20-period setting with Â±1.5-2.0 SD thresholds)
3. Optional: Volume confirmation for stronger signals

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in markets showing clear cyclical behavior
- Most effective on 1H-4H timeframes
- Performs well in both trending and ranging markets when properly filtered

Special Notes:
- Avoid trading during low volatility periods
- Combine with price action confirmation for best results
- Adjust DPO thresholds based on market volatility (wider for more volatile pairs)
