STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeCross  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Crossover:** Uses the relationship between 5-day and 20-day Historical Volatility (HV) to identify potential trend shifts.  
2. **Volume Surge Filter:** Requires volume to exceed 1.5x its 50-day average to confirm entries, ensuring participation.  
3. **Volatility-Based Exit:** Exits trades when 3-day volatility spikes above the 90th percentile, capturing extreme moves.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when 5-day HV crosses *below* 20-day HV (signaling potential stabilization/uptrend) **AND** volume > 1.5x 50-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when 5-day HV crosses *above* 20-day HV (signaling potential acceleration/downtrend) **AND** volume > 1.5x 50-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close position if the 3-day HV exceeds the 90th percentile of its historical range (predefined threshold), indicating excessive volatility and potential reversal/stop-run.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Optional trailing stop based on 2x the 5-day HV to account for volatility expansion.  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate capital based on the 20-day HV (higher volatility = smaller position).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Historical Volatility (5-day and 20-day)**  
2. **Volume (50-day average)**  
3. **90th Percentile Volatility Threshold** (calculated from historical 3-day HV data).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility regime shifts with volume confirmation, targeting low-volatility entries and exiting before extreme volatility spikes. Suitable for mean-reverting or breakout strategies depending on asset behavior.
