STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme volatility contraction followed by high-volume breakouts, combining Bollinger Band analysis with volume confirmation for high-probability trades.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures the 20-period BB width reaching its narrowest point in 3 months (60 trading days)
2. Volume Surge Confirmation: Requires volume to spike 200% above the 50-day average
3. Breakout Execution: Enters when price breaks through the Bollinger Band boundaries with volume confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 20-period Bollinger Band width to reach its lowest level in 3 months (confirmed by lowest BB width value in past 60 candles)
2. Monitor for volume exceeding the 50-day average volume by 200%
3. Enter long when price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with volume confirmation
4. Enter short when price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with volume confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands OR when the BB width expands to 3x the entry width
2. For short positions: Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands OR when the BB width expands to 3x the entry width
3. Optional trailing stop: Set at 2x the average true range (ATR) of past 14 periods

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss: Place initial stop at the opposite Bollinger Band level
3. Maximum holding period: Close all positions after 5 days if not stopped out

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume indicator with 50-day average
3. Bollinger Band width indicator (for measuring contraction)
4. Optional: 14-period ATR for trailing stops

Additional Notes:
- Best used on daily or 4-hour timeframes for reliable signals
- Works well with liquid assets that have consistent volume patterns
- Avoid using during major news events when volume spikes may be misleading
- Combine with price action confirmation (closing outside bands) for better reliability
