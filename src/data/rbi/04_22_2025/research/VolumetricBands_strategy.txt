STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBands  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines volume-weighted price action (VWAP) with Bollinger Band volatility expansion to identify high-probability trend entries. The core premise is to trade breakouts only when both volatility expansion and volume-confirmed trend alignment occur simultaneously.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **VWAP Slope** - Determines the underlying trend bias (positive slope = bullish, negative = bearish)  
2. **Bollinger Bands** - Identifies volatility expansion (band width increasing) and extreme price levels  
3. **Price-Band Interaction** - Requires decisive closes outside expanding bands  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Upper Bollinger Band is expanding (band width increasing)  
  2. Price closes above upper band  
  3. VWAP slope is positive (minimum 2-period confirmation)  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Lower Bollinger Band is expanding  
  2. Price closes below lower band  
  3. VWAP slope is negative (minimum 2-period confirmation)  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking:**  
  - Close position when price reverts to VWAP line  
  - Alternative: Trail stop at opposite Bollinger Band  

- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Initial stop placed at midpoint between entry band and VWAP  
  - Tightened to breakeven when price reaches 1.5x initial risk  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size limited to 1-2% account risk per trade  
- No new entries if VWAP slope flattens (<15-degree angle)  
- Avoid trading during first/last 30 minutes of session (VWAP distortion)  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. VWAP with slope calculation (20-period SMA of VWAP differences)  
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with band width measurement  
3. Price close monitoring (avoid wicks/tails triggering entries)  

**Unique Advantages:**  
- Filters false breakouts using volume confirmation  
- Capitalizes on volatility surges with trend alignment  
- Mean-reverting exit logic locks in profits before pullbacks  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test band periods (14-22) for different asset classes  
- Adjust slope confirmation period based on timeframe (shorter for intraday)  
- Combine with volume spike filter for higher probability setups
