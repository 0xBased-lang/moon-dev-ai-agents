STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicBreakoutX  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Donchian Channel Breakout:** Uses a 20-day Donchian channel (high/low range) to identify potential breakout levels.  
2. **ADX Confirmation:** Requires the ADX (Average Directional Index) to rise above 25 to confirm strong trend momentum.  
3. **Trailing ATR Stop:** Exits trades using a trailing stop set at 3x the Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits and limit losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Price closes above the upper 20-day Donchian channel (20-day high) **AND** ADX > 25 (rising).  
- **Short Entry:** Price closes below the lower 20-day Donchian channel (20-day low) **AND** ADX > 25 (rising).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** A dynamic stop-loss set at 3x ATR from the highest high (for long) or lowest low (for short) since entry.  
- **Optional Time Exit:** Consider closing trades after a fixed period (e.g., 10-15 bars) if the trailing stop hasn’t triggered.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 3x ATR stop distance to ensure risk per trade aligns with account size (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low ADX (<25) to filter out weak trends.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Donchian Channel (20-day high/low)** – Defines breakout levels.  
2. **ADX (14-period default)** – Confirms trend strength.  
3. **ATR (14-period default)** – Sets trailing stop distance.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines breakout mechanics with ADX trend confirmation for higher-probability entries.  
- Uses a volatility-adjusted trailing stop (3x ATR) for adaptive risk management.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring ADX > 25, ensuring trades align with strong trends.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different Donchian periods (e.g., 15-30 days) for varying market conditions.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (e.g., 2.5x-4x) based on asset volatility.  
- Pair with volume filters for additional confirmation.
