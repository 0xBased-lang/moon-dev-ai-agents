STRATEGY_NAME: VolcanicBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Donchian Channel Breakout:** Uses a 20-period Donchian Channel (high/low range) to identify potential breakout levels.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires the 50-period volume moving average (VMA) to spike above its 90th percentile, validating the breakout with strong participation.  
3. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Exit:** Monitors Bollinger Band width contraction (squeeze) to signal potential trend exhaustion and exit positions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when price closes **above** the upper 20-period Donchian Channel **AND** the 50-period VMA is above its 90th percentile (calculated over a lookback of 200 periods).  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when price closes **below** the lower 20-period Donchian Channel **AND** the 50-period VMA is above its 90th percentile.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** When Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 StdDev) width contracts to its lowest 20% of readings (squeeze) or price closes below the Donchian midline.  
- **Short Exit:** When Bollinger Band width contracts to its lowest 20% of readings or price closes above the Donchian midline.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop placed at the opposite Donchian boundary (e.g., long stop at lower channel line).  
- **Position Sizing:** Dynamic sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-adjusted risk per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Donchian Channel (20-period)** – Defines breakout thresholds.  
2. **50-Period Volume Moving Average (VMA)** – Filters breakouts with volume confirmation.  
3. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – Identifies squeeze conditions for exits.  
4. **Percentile Calculation (90th for VMA, 20th for BB width)** – Statistical thresholds for triggers.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility breakout (Donchian) with volume-fueled momentum and smart trend-exhaustion detection (Bollinger squeeze), reducing false breakouts.  

**Note:** Backtest optimal percentile thresholds and Donchian/Bollinger parameters for specific assets.
