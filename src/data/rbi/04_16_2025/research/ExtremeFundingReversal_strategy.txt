STRATEGY_NAME: ExtremeFundingReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme funding rate deviations combined with volume confirmation to identify high-probability reversal opportunities in perpetual futures markets.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Analysis: Uses 30-day mean and standard deviation to identify extreme funding conditions (>2Ïƒ)
2. Volume Confirmation: Requires a spike in trading volume to validate the signal
3. ATR-Based Exit: Uses 1.5x the event's Average True Range for profit-taking/stop-loss

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger Condition: 
   - Perpetual funding rate exceeds 2 standard deviations from 30-day mean
   - Concurrent volume spike (suggested: >20% above 14-day average)
2. Entry Direction:
   - Short when funding is extremely positive (traders over-leveraged long)
   - Long when funding is extremely negative (traders over-leveraged short)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Funding rate returns within 1 standard deviation of 30-day mean
2. Secondary Exit: Price moves 1.5x the ATR (calculated at time of entry) against position
3. Time-based Exit (optional): Consider closing after 3-5 days if neither condition met

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Adjust position size based on 1.5x ATR stop level
2. Stop Placement: 
   - Initial stop at 1.5x ATR from entry
   - Trailing stop possible after favorable move
3. Maximum Exposure: 
   - Limit to 3-5 concurrent positions
   - Avoid correlated assets

Required Indicators:
1. Perpetual Funding Rate (real-time)
2. 30-day Funding Rate Mean and Standard Deviation
3. Volume Indicator (14-day average recommended)
4. Average True Range (14-period recommended)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets where funding extremes are meaningful
- Most effective on major perpetual contracts (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- Consider filtering for liquid assets (>$50M daily volume)
- Backtest suggested for optimal ATR multiplier (1.5x may vary by asset)

This strategy exploits the mean-reverting nature of funding rates while using volume and volatility filters to improve signal quality and manage risk.
