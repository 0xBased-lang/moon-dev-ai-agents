STRATEGY_NAME: ContangoFade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility term structure analysis with trend strength measurement to identify favorable short volatility opportunities, using Bollinger Band expansion as an exit signal.

Key Components:
1. VIX Term Structure (Contango/Backwardation)
2. ADX (Average Directional Index) for trend strength
3. Bollinger Band Width for exit signals

Entry Rules:
1. VIX term structure must show contango > 2% (front month VIX futures trading at least 2% below second month)
2. ADX must be below 20 (indicating weak trend strength)
3. Both conditions must be met simultaneously to enter short volatility position

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor Bollinger Band width (standard deviation of price)
2. Exit position when Bollinger Band width expands beyond its 20-period moving average
3. Alternative exit: If contango flips to backwardation (VIX futures curve inverts)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (smaller positions during high VIX)
2. Stop-loss if VIX spikes > 10% from entry level
3. Maximum allocation of 5% per trade
4. Avoid trading during major economic events

Required Indicators:
1. VIX futures term structure (front two months)
2. ADX (14-period standard setting)
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard settings)
4. Bollinger Band width calculation

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for VIX futures or volatility ETFs
- Works well in range-bound markets
- Avoid during strong trending markets (when ADX > 30)
- Most effective when combined with mean-reversion indicators
- Requires monitoring of VIX futures roll dates

This strategy capitalizes on the tendency of volatility to mean-revert during periods of weak trends and favorable term structure, while using Bollinger Band expansion as an early warning for potential volatility spikes.
