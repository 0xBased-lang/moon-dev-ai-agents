STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiditySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidity Gap Exploitation**: The strategy capitalizes on sudden liquidity shifts when price breaks out of tight consolidation.  
2. **Keltner Channels**: Used to define the consolidation range (default settings: 20-period EMA, 1.5x ATR multiplier). Narrow channels indicate low volatility and impending breakout potential.  
3. **Volume Surge Filter**: Requires volume to spike **300% above the 20-day average** to confirm institutional participation and reduce false breakouts.  
4. **Profit Target**: Fixed at **1.5x the initial breakout range** (high-low of the consolidation phase).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Price closes **above the upper Keltner Channel** AND volume exceeds 20-day average by 300%.  
- **Short Entry**: Price closes **below the lower Keltner Channel** AND volume exceeds 20-day average by 300%.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**: Exit at 1.5x the consolidation range (measured from breakout point).  
- **Stop Loss**: Place at the **opposite Keltner Channel boundary** (e.g., for long entries, stop loss is the lower channel line).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Risk â‰¤1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop-Loss Adjustment**: If volume surges but price retraces into the channel, exit immediately (failed breakout).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channels** (20-period EMA, 1.5x ATR).  
2. **Volume Average** (20-day SMA).  
3. **ATR** (14-period for channel width).  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines **liquidity signals** (volume surge) with **price compression** (narrow Keltner) to target high-probability breakouts.  
- Avoids choppy markets by requiring extreme volume confirmation.  

**Note:** Backtest on assets with historically strong breakout tendencies (e.g., indices, large-cap stocks).
