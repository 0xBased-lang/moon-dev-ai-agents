STRATEGY_NAME: BandVwapSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandVwapSync strategy combines Bollinger Band mean-reversion signals with VWAP momentum confirmation for precise entries and exits. This hybrid approach synchronizes volatility-based support levels with volume-weighted trend confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies potential reversal zones at lower band
2. 20-period VWAP - Confirms trend direction with volume weighting
3. 5-period MA of VWAP - Provides dynamic exit signal
4. Bollinger Bandwidth - Calculates adaptive stop levels

Entry Rules:
1. Price must touch or penetrate the lower Bollinger Band
2. 20-period VWAP slope must be positive (current VWAP > previous VWAP)
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit when VWAP crosses below its 5-period moving average
2. Secondary exit if price reaches upper Bollinger Band (optional profit-taking)

Stop Management:
1. Initial stop placed at:
   - Lower band value minus (Bandwidth * 0.5) for tighter stops
   - OR lower band value minus Bandwidth for wider stops
2. Trailing stop option: Move stop to breakeven when price reaches middle band

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 periods, 2 standard deviations
- VWAP: 20-period rolling calculation
- MA of VWAP: 5-period simple moving average

Risk Management Guidelines:
1. Position size should not exceed 2% of capital per trade
2. Minimum reward/risk ratio of 1.5:1 required
3. Avoid trading during major news events when bands may expand abnormally

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets with moderate volatility
- Effective on 15min-4hr timeframes
- Strongest signals occur after prolonged trends when price first returns to lower band

Additional Filters (optional):
- RSI(14) > 30 to avoid oversold continuation
- Volume above 20-period average for confirmation
- MACD histogram turning positive as confluence
