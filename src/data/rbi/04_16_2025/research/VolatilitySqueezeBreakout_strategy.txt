STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by high-momentum breakouts, using a combination of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify potential trade setups.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Contraction Detection:
   - Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
   - Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier)
   - Squeeze occurs when Bollinger Bands move inside Keltner Channels

2. Breakout Confirmation:
   - Price must close outside either band with increased volume
   - Volume must exceed 20-period moving average by 50%
   - MACD (12,26,9) must show same-direction momentum

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - When price closes above upper Bollinger Band
   - Volume surge confirmation (50% above 20MA)
   - MACD histogram trending upward
   - Squeeze condition was present for at least 5 bars

2. Short Entry:
   - When price closes below lower Bollinger Band
   - Volume surge confirmation (50% above 20MA)
   - MACD histogram trending downward
   - Squeeze condition was present for at least 5 bars

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - When price reaches 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the squeeze period
   - OR when bands diverge beyond their 20-period historical average width

2. Stop Loss:
   - Fixed at 1x ATR from entry point
   - OR opposite band crossover (whichever comes first)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum 3 concurrent positions
3. No trading during major economic news events
4. Daily time filter (avoid first/last 30 minutes)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Keltner Channels (20,1.5 ATR)
3. Volume (20MA)
4. MACD (12,26,9)
5. ATR (14)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on asset volatility
- Test different squeeze duration requirements
- Consider adding RSI filter for overbought/oversold conditions
- Backtest various profit target multiples

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending conditions, with reduced effectiveness during strong, established trends or extremely volatile conditions.
