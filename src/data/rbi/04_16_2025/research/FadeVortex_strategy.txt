STRATEGY_NAME: FadeVortex  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Contrarian Approach**: The strategy fades price extremes, betting on mean reversion when conditions indicate overextension.  
2. **Choppiness Index (CI)**: Used to identify low-trending, choppy markets when CI > 75, signaling potential exhaustion.  
3. **Volume Decline**: Confirms weakening momentum when volume decreases alongside high CI.  
4. **20-period VWAP**: Acts as the mean reversion target, providing a dynamic support/resistance level.  
5. **Bollinger Bands**: Used for exit signals when price breaks beyond the bands, indicating volatility expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter short when:  
  - Choppiness Index > 75 (indicating a choppy, range-bound market).  
  - Volume is declining compared to recent periods (e.g., 5-period moving average of volume).  
  - Price is at or near a recent high (suggesting an extreme).  
- Enter long when:  
  - Choppiness Index > 75.  
  - Volume is declining.  
  - Price is at or near a recent low.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**: Close position when price reaches the 20-period VWAP (mean reversion target).  
- **Stop Loss**: Exit if price exceeds the Bollinger Band threshold (e.g., upper band for shorts, lower band for longs), indicating volatility expansion and potential trend continuation.  
- **Time-Based Exit**: Consider exiting if the trade does not revert to VWAP within a set number of bars (e.g., 10-15 periods).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the distance to the VWAP and Bollinger Bands to ensure favorable risk-reward (e.g., 1:2 or better).  
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events that may disrupt mean reversion behavior.  
- Use a trailing stop or partial profit-taking near VWAP if the market shows hesitation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Choppiness Index (CI)** – To identify range-bound conditions (default period: 14).  
2. **Volume** – To confirm weakening momentum (compare to a moving average, e.g., 5-period).  
3. **20-period VWAP** – The mean reversion target.  
4. **Bollinger Bands** (default: 20-period, 2 standard deviations) – For volatility-based exits.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in sideways or mildly trending markets; avoid strong trending conditions.  
- Backtest to optimize CI threshold (e.g., 70-80) and volume decline criteria.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., rejection candles at extremes) for higher-probability entries.  

This strategy capitalizes on exhaustion moves in choppy markets, using volume and volatility filters to refine entries and exits. The name **"FadeVortex"** reflects its contrarian nature ("Fade") and the swirling, choppy conditions ("Vortex") it exploits.
