STRATEGY_NAME: VolterraSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify volatility compression
- Uses Bollinger Band width percentile to quantify squeeze conditions
- Requires Keltner Channel contraction as confirmation
- Incorporates volume surge as breakout validation
- Focuses on closing price breakouts for confirmation

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for Bollinger Band width to fall below 20th percentile (indicating squeeze)
- Confirm Keltner Channel is contracting (width decreasing)
- Enter long when price closes ABOVE both upper bands with:
  - Volume at least 150% of 20-day average
  - Close must be outside both upper bands
- Enter short when price closes BELOW both lower bands with:
  - Volume at least 150% of 20-day average
  - Close must be outside both lower bands

3. Exit Rules:
- For long positions:
  - Take profit at 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry
  - Stop loss at 0.75x ATR below entry or below recent swing low
- For short positions:
  - Take profit at 1.5x ATR from entry
  - Stop loss at 0.75x ATR above entry or above recent swing high
- Alternative exit: Close position if Bollinger Band width expands above 80th percentile

4. Risk Management:
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
- Avoid trading during major economic news events
- Prefer setups with higher time frame alignment (daily chart confirming 4h signal)

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Keltner Channels (20,2)
- Bollinger Band width percentile (20-period lookback)
- Volume indicator with 20-day average
- Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Avoid using during strong trending markets (bands may remain wide)
- Ideal for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- Requires patience as squeeze conditions may take time to develop
- Backtest suggests best performance on 4h-1d timeframes
