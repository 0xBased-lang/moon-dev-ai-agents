STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFader  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cluster Analysis:** The strategy focuses on identifying high-probability liquidation levels derived from aggregated exchange data. These levels represent zones where a large number of stop-loss orders or liquidations are likely to occur.  
2. **Volatility Filter:** Uses ATR (Average True Range) to gauge market volatility. Entries are only considered during ATR spikes, indicating heightened market activity.  
3. **Entry Trigger:** Requires a 15-minute candle close exceeding 2x ATR from the liquidation cluster level, signaling a strong move that may reverse due to liquidity grabs.  
4. **Exit Mechanism:** Implements a trailing stop set at 1.5x ATR to lock in profits while allowing room for volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Identify a high-probability liquidation cluster level using aggregated exchange data.  
- Wait for an ATR spike (e.g., ATR value significantly above its moving average).  
- Enter a fade (counter-trend) trade when the 15-minute candle closes beyond 2x ATR from the liquidation level.  
- Trade direction is opposite to the candle close (e.g., short if price closes above the level, long if below).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Set a trailing stop at 1.5x ATR from the entry price.  
- Adjust the trailing stop dynamically as the trade moves in your favor.  
- Exit the trade when the trailing stop is hit.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the volatility (e.g., smaller positions during higher ATR values).  
- Avoid trading during low volatility (ATR below a certain threshold).  
- Consider a maximum risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ATR (Average True Range):** To measure volatility and set entry/exit thresholds.  
2. **Liquidation Cluster Data:** Aggregated exchange data highlighting high-probability liquidation levels.  
3. **15-minute Candlestick Chart:** For timing entries and exits.  

This strategy capitalizes on market inefficiencies around liquidation events, using volatility as a filter and ATR-based stops to manage risk. The unique combination of liquidation zones and ATR spikes makes it distinct from standard mean-reversion or breakout strategies.
