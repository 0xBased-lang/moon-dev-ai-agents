STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection** – Identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Bands contract significantly.  
2. **Donchian Channel Breakout** – Confirms the breakout direction by checking if price exceeds the 20-day high/low.  
3. **Donchian Channel Width Expansion** – Ensures volatility is increasing, validating the breakout.  
4. **ADX Trend Strength Filter** – Exits trades when trend momentum weakens (ADX < 25).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band (squeeze breakout).  
  - Price exceeds the 20-day Donchian high.  
  - Donchian Channel width is expanding (volatility increasing).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band (squeeze breakout).  
  - Price falls below the 20-day Donchian low.  
  - Donchian Channel width is expanding (volatility increasing).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** ADX(14) drops below 25 (trend weakening).  
- **Short Exit:** ADX(14) drops below 25 (trend weakening).  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:**  
  - For longs: Recent swing low or lower Bollinger Band.  
  - For shorts: Recent swing high or upper Bollinger Band.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stops).  
- Avoid trading during extremely narrow Bollinger Bands (potential false breakouts).  
- Wait for Donchian Channel confirmation to reduce whipsaws.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2)** – Identifies squeeze conditions.  
2. **Donchian Channel (20)** – Confirms breakout highs/lows.  
3. **ADX (14)** – Measures trend strength for exits.  
4. **Optional:** ATR (14) for dynamic stop-loss placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines Bollinger squeeze (low volatility) with Donchian breakout (high volatility expansion).  
- Uses ADX to avoid exiting prematurely in strong trends.  
- Filters false breakouts by requiring Donchian Channel width expansion.  

This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation phases. Backtest for optimal parameter tuning (e.g., ADX threshold, Donchian period).
