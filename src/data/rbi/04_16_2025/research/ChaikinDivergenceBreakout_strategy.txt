STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinDivergenceBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Chaikin Money Flow with MACD histogram divergence to identify high-probability breakout trades, using volume spikes and trendline analysis for precise exits.

Key Components:
1. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) - 20-period standard setting
2. MACD Histogram (12,26,9 default settings)
3. Volume analysis (raw volume spikes)
4. Trendline analysis (manual drawing required)

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
1. CMF must cross ABOVE zero line (bullish money flow)
2. Concurrent BULLISH MACD histogram divergence (price makes lower low while histogram makes higher low)
3. Price must break above recent swing high (confirms breakout)

SHORT ENTRY:
1. CMF must cross BELOW zero line (bearish money flow)
2. Concurrent BEARISH MACD histogram divergence (price makes higher high while histogram makes lower high)
3. Price must break below recent swing low (confirms breakout)

Exit Rules:
LONG EXIT:
1. Bearish volume spike (volume exceeds 150% of 20-period average on down candle)
2. Break below upward trendline (connect at least 2 swing lows)
3. CMF crosses below zero line (confirms loss of buying pressure)

SHORT EXIT:
1. Bullish volume spike (volume exceeds 150% of 20-period average on up candle)
2. Break above downward trendline (connect at least 2 swing highs)
3. CMF crosses above zero line (confirms loss of selling pressure)

Risk Management:
1. Position size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop placement:
   - Longs: Below most recent swing low or 1.5x ATR(14) below entry
   - Shorts: Above most recent swing high or 1.5x ATR(14) above entry
3. Profit targets:
   - Primary: 2:1 risk-reward ratio
   - Secondary: Trail stop when CMF reverses direction

Required Indicators:
1. Chaikin Money Flow (20 period)
2. MACD (12,26,9 settings)
3. Volume indicator (raw or SMA)
4. ATR (14 period for stop calculation)

Additional Notes:
- Best used on 1H or 4H timeframes for reliable signals
- Requires confluence of all three elements (CMF, MACD divergence, breakout)
- Avoid trading during low volume periods (overnight sessions, holidays)
- Works particularly well in trending markets, less effective in choppy conditions

This strategy's strength lies in combining money flow confirmation with momentum divergence, creating high-probability breakout trades with clear risk parameters.
