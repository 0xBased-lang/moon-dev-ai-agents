STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band volatility compression with volume-based confirmation signals for high-probability breakout trades. The core concept revolves around identifying periods of low volatility (squeeze) followed by high-volume breakouts with trend confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Percentile (20,2) - Measures volatility compression
2. Klinger Volume Oscillator (34,55,13) - Detects volume divergences
3. Price action relative to Bollinger Bands

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Entry:
- Bollinger Band width percentile < 20 (volatility squeeze condition)
- Price closes outside the Bollinger Bands
- KVO shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low while KVO makes higher low) for long entries
- KVO shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high while KVO makes lower high) for short entries

2. Secondary Confirmation:
- Volume on breakout candle exceeds 20-period average
- Breakout occurs in direction of prevailing higher timeframe trend

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
- Trail stop at opposite Bollinger Band
- Close 50% position when price reaches 1.5x average true range (ATR) target
- Close remaining position at 3x ATR target

2. Stop Loss:
- Initial stop placed at middle Bollinger Band
- For long positions, stop below most recent swing low
- For short positions, stop above most recent swing high

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Avoid trading during major economic news events

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Band Width Percentile (20-period)
3. Klinger Volume Oscillator (34,55,13)
4. Average True Range (14-period)
5. Volume MA (20-period)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation periods
- Most effective on 1H-4H timeframes
- Ideal for liquid instruments with consistent volume patterns

Special Notes:
- Requires manual confirmation of volume patterns
- Works best when combined with higher timeframe trend analysis
- May generate false signals in choppy, range-bound markets
