STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationClusterBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on VWAP clusters formed during high liquidation events (market extremes where forced liquidations occur)
- Uses Bollinger Band width to confirm volatility contraction (signaling potential breakout conditions)
- Monitors volume-weighted momentum for divergence from price trajectory (exit signal)
- Combines volume analysis (VWAP) with volatility metrics (Bollinger Bands) and momentum divergence

2. Entry Rules:
- Identify VWAP clusters formed during high liquidation events (look for extreme price moves with high volume)
- Wait for volatility contraction (Bollinger Band width narrowing to below average levels)
- Enter long when price breaks above the VWAP cluster with expanding volume
- Enter short when price breaks below the VWAP cluster with expanding volume
- Confirmation: Breakout should occur with volume at least 1.5x the average of recent periods

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary exit: When volume-weighted momentum (price*volume oscillator) diverges from price trajectory
  - For long positions: Price makes higher high but momentum makes lower high
  - For short positions: Price makes lower low but momentum makes higher low
- Secondary exit: When Bollinger Band width expands beyond 2 standard deviations from its mean
- Emergency exit: If price returns inside the VWAP cluster after breakout

4. Risk Management:
- Initial stop placed at the opposite side of the VWAP cluster
- Position sizing based on distance to stop (risk no more than 1-2% per trade)
- Trail stop to breakeven once price moves 1.5x the initial risk
- Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of capital

5. Required Indicators:
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) with cluster identification
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) with width measurement
- Volume-weighted momentum oscillator (custom indicator combining price and volume)
- Volume profile (to confirm breakout validity)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid markets with frequent liquidation events (crypto, futures)
- Timeframe: 15min to 4hr charts optimal
- Requires clean chart reading to identify true VWAP clusters
- Works best when combined with overall market context (trend direction, liquidity levels)

This strategy capitalizes on the unique market structure created by forced liquidations, where VWAP clusters act as significant support/resistance zones, and combines this with volatility contraction and momentum divergence for high-probability entries and exits.
