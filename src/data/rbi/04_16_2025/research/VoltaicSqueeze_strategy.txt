STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Squeeze Detection:** Uses Bollinger Bands (BB) and Keltner Channels (KC) to identify periods of low volatility (squeeze) when BB is inside KC.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires a breakout above (long) or below (short) the Bollinger Bands with volume confirmation.  
3. **Trend Strength Filter:** Uses ADX (Average Directional Index) to ensure the breakout has sufficient momentum (ADX > 25).  
4. **Volume Validation:** Entry is confirmed only if volume is above its moving average (e.g., 20-period MA).  
5. **Exit Condition:** Exits when volume drops below its moving average, signaling weakening momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. BB is inside KC (volatility squeeze).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume is above its 20-period moving average.  
  4. ADX > 25 (confirming trend strength).  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. BB is inside KC (volatility squeeze).  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume is above its 20-period moving average.  
  4. ADX > 25 (confirming trend strength).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the trade when volume falls below its 20-period moving average.  
- Optional: Use a trailing stop (e.g., ATR-based) to protect profits.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss just outside the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., lower band for long, upper band for short).  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20, 2).  
2. Keltner Channels (20, 2).  
3. Volume (20-period MA).  
4. ADX (14-period).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility squeeze (BB + KC) with volume and ADX filters for high-probability breakouts.  
- Exits on volume decline rather than fixed targets, capturing trends while avoiding false reversals.  

**Note:** Works best in trending markets; avoid ranging conditions (ADX < 20).
