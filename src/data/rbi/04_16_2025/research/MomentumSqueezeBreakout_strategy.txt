STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with volatility contraction to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components are:

1. INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) - 20 period recommended
- Keltner Channel - 20 period ATR, 1.5 multiplier recommended
- Keltner Channel Width 20-day moving average

2. ENTRY RULES:
Long Entry:
- CMO crosses above 50 level (bullish momentum confirmation)
- Current Keltner Channel width is below its 20-day average (volatility contraction)
- Price breaks above upper Keltner Channel band

Short Entry:
- CMO crosses below -50 level (bearish momentum confirmation)
- Current Keltner Channel width is below its 20-day average (volatility contraction)
- Price breaks below lower Keltner Channel band

3. EXIT RULES:
- Close position when Keltner Channel width expands above its 20-day average
- Secondary exit: Trailing stop at opposite Keltner band
- Time-based exit after 5 bars if no expansion occurs

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Initial stop at opposite Keltner band
- Maximum trade duration: 5 bars
- Avoid trading during major economic news events

5. FILTERS:
- Only trade in direction of higher timeframe trend (optional)
- Minimum ATR requirement (optional)
- Volume confirmation (optional)

6. UNIQUE ASPECTS:
- Combines momentum confirmation with volatility contraction
- Uses channel width as both entry filter and exit signal
- Self-adjusting stop levels via Keltner bands
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends

7. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Adjust CMO period (14-30) for sensitivity
- Test different ATR multipliers (1.5-2.5)
- Experiment with channel width MA period (10-30)
- Consider adding volume or trend filters

This strategy excels in capturing breakouts from low volatility periods with confirmed momentum, while using the channel expansion as a natural exit mechanism for both profits and losses.
