STRATEGY_NAME: Voltrend Flip

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The Voltrend Flip strategy combines trend direction confirmation with explosive volume momentum for high-probability entries, using a volatility-based trailing stop for exits.

Key Components:
1. SuperTrend Indicator (Primary Trend Filter)
2. Elder Force Index (Volume-Momentum Confirmation)
3. ATR (Volatility-Based Stop Management)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for SuperTrend to flip direction (bullish when price crosses above, bearish when below)
2. Concurrently require Elder Force Index's volume component to show 2x surge compared to its 10-period average
3. Both conditions must occur within the same candle or consecutive candles

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When SuperTrend flips to opposite direction
2. Secondary Exit: 1.5x ATR trailing stop (calculated from entry price)
   - For long positions: trail stop at (current price - 1.5x ATR)
   - For short positions: trail stop at (current price + 1.5x ATR)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1.5x ATR stop distance
2. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
3. No pyramiding - single position per signal
4. Time-based exit if price stagnates (consider exiting if no significant movement after 5-7 bars)

Required Indicators:
1. SuperTrend (recommended settings: 10 period, 3 multiplier)
2. Elder Force Index (13-period EMA recommended)
3. Average True Range (14-period standard)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different ATR multiples (1.25x-2x) for stop placement
2. Experiment with SuperTrend period (7-14) and multiplier (2-4)
3. Validate volume surge threshold (1.8x-2.5x) for your instrument

This strategy excels in trending markets with strong volume participation, while the ATR stop protects profits during volatile reversals. The unique combination of trend confirmation with volume surge creates high-quality signals with favorable risk/reward profiles.
