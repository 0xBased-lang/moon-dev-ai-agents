STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationContrarian

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation zone analysis with volume and momentum divergence to identify high-probability reversal opportunities in the 1-hour timeframe.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Level Identification:
   - Uses order book analysis to detect clustered high-leverage zones
   - Identifies price levels where many stop losses are likely clustered
   - These zones act as potential reversal points when price rejects them

2. Confirmation Indicators:
   - OBV (On-Balance Volume): Looks for divergence between price and volume
   - RSI (14-period): Identifies momentum divergence at key levels

Entry Rules:
1. Price must reject a clear liquidation level (minimum 3% move away from level)
2. Must see either:
   - Bullish case: Lower price low with higher OBV and RSI making higher low
   - Bearish case: Higher price high with lower OBV and RSI making lower high
3. Entry on first pullback after rejection candle closes

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit:
   - Primary target at next significant liquidation level
   - Secondary target at 1.5x risk
2. Stop Loss:
   - Placed just beyond the rejected liquidation level
   - Maximum 2% of account risk per trade

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. No more than 3 concurrent trades
3. Daily loss limit of 5%
4. Weekly loss limit of 10%

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation level heatmap (order book analysis tool)
2. OBV (On-Balance Volume)
3. RSI (14-period)
4. Price action confirmation

Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging or mildly trending markets
- Avoid during strong trending conditions
- Most effective on major crypto pairs with liquid order books
- Requires patience to wait for clear rejection patterns
