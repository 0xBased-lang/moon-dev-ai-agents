STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band compression with explosive volume signals to capture high-probability breakout opportunities. The unique combination of bandwidth measurement and volume spike creates a powerful confluence for identifying meaningful breakouts.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection: Uses the narrowest 5-day bandwidth to identify periods of extreme compression
2. Volume Surge Filter: Requires 200% increase over 20-day average volume to confirm breakout validity
3. Time-Based Exit: Implements 48-hour maximum holding period to prevent overexposure

Entry Rules:
- Trigger: Price must close outside either Bollinger Band (upper or lower)
- Confirmation: Volume must be at least 200% of 20-day average volume
- Timing: Both conditions must occur simultaneously on the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price touches the opposite Bollinger Band
2. Secondary Exit: After 48 hours (2880 minutes) if opposite band isn't touched
3. Emergency Exit: Immediate exit if price re-enters the bands before touching opposite side

Risk Management:
- Position sizing should account for the volatility expansion (recommend 1-2% risk per trade)
- No new entries allowed until current position is closed
- Avoid trading during major economic news events that may distort volume patterns

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation standard settings)
2. Volume indicator with 20-day average calculation
3. Bandwidth measurement tool (high-low range of bands over 5 days)
4. Time-based exit alarm (48-hour countdown)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different bandwidth periods (3-7 days) for squeeze detection
- Experiment with volume thresholds (150-250% of average)
- Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., >70/<30) for overbought/oversold confirmation

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the volume surge as confirmation of genuine breakout rather than false breakout. The time-based exit prevents excessive drawdown during failed breakouts.
