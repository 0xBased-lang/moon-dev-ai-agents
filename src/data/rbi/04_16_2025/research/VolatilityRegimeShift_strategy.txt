STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityRegimeShift  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Measures volatility compression, signaling potential breakout opportunities when the bandwidth crosses below its 50-period SMA.  
2. **1-Hour TWAP Deviation:** Confirms the trade setup when the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) deviates more than 1.5 standard deviations (σ), indicating strong directional momentum.  
3. **Volatility Regime Shift Focus:** The strategy specifically targets transitions from low to high volatility, capitalizing on breakout momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth crosses below its 50-period SMA (volatility contraction).  
  - 1-hour TWAP moves above +1.5σ from its mean (bullish momentum confirmation).  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth crosses below its 50-period SMA (volatility contraction).  
  - 1-hour TWAP moves below -1.5σ from its mean (bearish momentum confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Exit when Bollinger Bandwidth expands significantly (e.g., crosses back above its 50-period SMA), indicating volatility expansion and potential trend exhaustion.  
- **Stop Loss:** Set at a fixed risk percentage (e.g., 1-2% of account equity) or a volatility-based stop (e.g., 2x ATR).  
- **Opposing Signal Exit:** Close the trade if the opposite entry condition appears (e.g., long exit if TWAP drops below -1.5σ).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-adjusted).  
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital.  
- Avoid trading during major news events unless confirmed by the strategy’s signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To calculate bandwidth contraction.  
2. **50-period SMA of Bollinger Bandwidth** – For volatility regime confirmation.  
3. **1-hour TWAP** – For momentum deviation confirmation.  
4. **Standard Deviation (σ) of TWAP** – To measure significant price deviations.  
5. **Optional: ATR (14)** – For dynamic stop-loss placement.  

This strategy excels in trending markets after periods of low volatility, making it ideal for breakout traders who want to avoid false signals with additional TWAP confirmation.
