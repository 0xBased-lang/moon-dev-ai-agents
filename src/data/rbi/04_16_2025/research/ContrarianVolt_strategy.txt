STRATEGY_NAME: ContrarianVolt  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Contrarian Approach:** The strategy capitalizes on extreme bearish sentiment by taking long positions when the market is oversold.  
2. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** A momentum indicator used to identify oversold conditions when it crosses below -50.  
3. **Negative Funding Rates:** A spike in negative funding rates signals excessive short positioning, reinforcing the contrarian signal.  
4. **Volatility Band Exit:** The 20-period volatility band (likely Bollinger Bands or Keltner Channels) acts as a dynamic exit point for profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Trigger Condition:** Enter a long position when:  
   - The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) crosses below -50 (oversold condition).  
   - There is a concurrent spike in negative funding rates (indicating extreme bearish sentiment).  
2. **Confirmation:** Ensure price is not in a strong downtrend (e.g., check if the 50-period moving average is not sloping downward sharply).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit-Taking:** Exit the trade when price retraces to the upper 20-period volatility band (e.g., Bollinger Band upper band or Keltner Channel upper line).  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) to limit downside risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Use conservative position sizing (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade) due to the high volatility of contrarian plays.  
2. **Stop-Loss Discipline:** Strictly adhere to stop-loss levels to avoid large drawdowns.  
3. **Avoid Overleveraging:** Given the mean-reversion nature, excessive leverage can lead to quick liquidation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** Default settings (typically 14-period).  
2. **Funding Rate Data:** Real-time or historical funding rates from the exchange.  
3. **Volatility Bands:** 20-period Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations) or Keltner Channels (1.5 ATR multiplier).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in ranging or moderately trending markets but may fail in strong bearish trends.  
- Backtest across multiple assets to validate robustness, as funding rate dynamics vary by market.  
- Combine with volume analysis to confirm capitulation (e.g., high volume during CMO breakdown).  

The name "ContrarianVolt" reflects the strategyâ€™s core: a contrarian play ("Contrarian") combined with volatility-based exits ("Volt" for volatility bands).
