STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeAccel  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume Acceleration Rate (5-day):** Measures the rate of change in trading volume over 5 days, indicating increasing/decreasing market participation.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility when price is confined within tightening Bollinger Bands (typically using 20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations).  
3. **ATR (Average True Range):** Used for dynamic exit thresholds based on recent volatility (1.5x multiplier).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - 5-day volume acceleration rate exceeds +2 standard deviations from its mean.  
  - Price is within a Bollinger Band squeeze (bands width â‰¤ 50% of 20-day average width).  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - 5-day volume acceleration rate drops below -2 standard deviations from its mean.  
  - Price remains confined in the Bollinger Band squeeze.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking:** Close position when price touches the opposing Bollinger Band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Exit if price moves against the position by 1.5x the current 14-period ATR.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade (stop distance = 1.5x ATR).  
- No new entries if volatility (BB width) expands beyond 150% of the squeeze threshold.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 StdDev).  
2. Volume Acceleration Rate (5-day ROC of volume, standardized).  
3. ATR (14-period for stop calculation).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volume spikes (breakout fuel) with low-volatility setups (squeeze), targeting explosive moves while capping risk via ATR.
