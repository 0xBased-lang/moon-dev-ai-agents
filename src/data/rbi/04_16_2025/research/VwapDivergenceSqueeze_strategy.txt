STRATEGY_NAME: VwapDivergenceSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted price divergence with volatility contraction for high-probability entries, using ATR-based dynamic exits.

Key Components:
1. VWAP 3-day Rate of Change (ROC) - Measures momentum of the volume-weighted average price
2. Price-VWAP Divergence - Identifies when price action disagrees with volume-weighted momentum
3. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction - Measures volatility compression below its 20-day median
4. 2x ATR Exit - Dynamic position management based on volatility

Entry Rules:
1. CONFIRM DIVERGENCE:
   - Bullish Setup: Price makes lower low while VWAP 3-day ROC makes higher low
   - Bearish Setup: Price makes higher high while VWAP 3-day ROC makes lower high
2. VOLATILITY FILTER:
   - Bollinger Bandwidth must be below its 20-day median value
3. ENTRY EXECUTION:
   - Long entries on bullish divergence confirmation
   - Short entries on bearish divergence confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. PRIMARY EXIT:
   - Close position when price moves against you by 2x the current ATR(14)
2. OPTIONAL PROFIT TAKING:
   - Consider 1:2 risk-reward ratio based on entry ATR
   - Trail stop to 1x ATR after 2x ATR profit reached

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Calculate position size using 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Use ATR(14) to determine dollar risk per share
2. Stop Placement:
   - Initial stop at 2x ATR from entry price
3. Maximum Exposure:
   - Limit to 3-5 concurrent positions

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
2. 3-day Rate of Change of VWAP
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
4. Bollinger Bandwidth (%)
5. 20-day Median of Bandwidth
6. ATR (14-period)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ROC periods (2-5 days) for VWAP
- Experiment with bandwidth thresholds (30th-40th percentile instead of median)
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5x-3x) based on market volatility

This strategy excels in ranging markets where volatility contractions precede directional moves, using volume-weighted momentum as a leading indicator. The combination of divergence detection with volatility filtering creates high-quality setups, while the ATR-based exit adapts to changing market conditions.
