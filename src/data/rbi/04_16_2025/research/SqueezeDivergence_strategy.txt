STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection:** Identifies periods of low volatility when the bands contract significantly, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Divergence:** Confirms breakout strength by ensuring volume supports the price movement (bullish divergence for long entries, bearish for short).  
3. **ATR-Based Trailing Stop:** Manages risk dynamically by adjusting stops based on market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands show a squeeze (bandwidth at recent lows).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. OBV shows a bullish divergence (rising OBV while price was consolidating or declining).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands show a squeeze.  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. OBV shows a bearish divergence (falling OBV while price was consolidating or rising).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Trailing stop based on 1.5x ATR (14-period) from the peak/trough after entry.  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Initial stop: Opposite Bollinger Band touch (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs).  
  - Exit if OBV reverses direction against the trade (e.g., OBV starts declining after a long entry).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid entries during major economic news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV).  
3. Average True Range (ATR, 14-period).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with volume confirmation (OBV divergence) for higher-probability breakouts.  
- Uses ATR for adaptive trailing stops, aligning risk with market conditions.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different ATR multipliers (e.g., 1.2x–2x) for trailing stops.  
- Adjust Bollinger Band settings (e.g., 18–22 periods) for specific assets.  
- Filter trades with a 50-period SMA trend alignment (e.g., only long if price > SMA50).
