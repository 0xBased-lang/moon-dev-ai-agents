STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicTrendSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicTrendSync strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum strength to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to filter trades and manage risk.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification (EMA Crossover):
   - 50-period EMA crossing above 200-period EMA signals bullish trend establishment
   - This "Golden Cross" serves as the primary trend confirmation

2. Trend Strength Filter (ADX):
   - Requires ADX > 25 to confirm strong trending conditions
   - Exits when ADX < 20 indicating weakening trend momentum

3. Overbought Protection (RSI):
   - Uses RSI > 70 as exit signal to prevent holding during potential reversals
   - Provides secondary exit condition independent of trend strength

Entry Rules:
- Enter long position when ALL conditions are met:
  1. 50-EMA crosses above 200-EMA (bullish crossover)
  2. ADX rises above 25 (strong trend confirmation)
  3. Price must be above both EMAs (additional confirmation)

Exit Rules:
- Close position when ANY condition occurs:
  1. ADX falls below 20 (trend weakening)
  2. RSI exceeds 70 (overbought condition)
  3. 50-EMA crosses below 200-EMA (trend reversal)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Recommended 1-2% risk per trade
   - Adjust position size based on stop-loss distance

2. Stop-Loss Placement:
   - Initial stop below recent swing low
   - Trailing stop can be placed below 50-EMA as trade progresses

3. Trade Filtering:
   - Only trades with ADX > 25 ensure strong trends
   - RSI filter prevents chasing overextended moves

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Moving Averages:
   - 50-period EMA (fast)
   - 200-period EMA (slow)

2. Average Directional Index (ADX):
   - 14-period standard setting
   - Thresholds at 25 (entry) and 20 (exit)

3. Relative Strength Index (RSI):
   - 14-period standard setting
   - 70 level for overbought exit

Optimization Notes:
- ADX period can be adjusted between 10-20 for different markets
- EMA periods can be modified (e.g., 20/50 for shorter timeframes)
- RSI threshold can be tightened to 65 for more conservative exits

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals during ranging conditions. The combination of trend confirmation (EMA crossover) with momentum validation (ADX) creates a robust framework for capturing sustained moves while the RSI provides protection against overextension.
