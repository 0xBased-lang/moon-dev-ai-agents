STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme volatility contraction followed by high-volume breakouts, using Bollinger Band metrics and volume z-scores for precise timing.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP) - Measures volatility contraction
2. Volume Z-Score - Identifies abnormal volume spikes
3. Bollinger Band Expansion Threshold - Signals potential exit conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for BBWP to drop below 10th percentile (extreme volatility contraction)
2. Confirm with volume z-score > 2 (significant volume surge)
3. Enter long/short in direction of price breaking the Bollinger Band

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit when BBWP exceeds 90th percentile (volatility expansion)
2. Secondary exit if price closes back inside Bollinger Bands
3. Optional: Trail stop at recent swing low/high

Risk Management:
1. Position size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop: Recent swing low/high or opposite band
3. Maximum holding period: 5 days (prevents overexposure)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations recommended)
2. Bollinger Band Width calculation: (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band
3. Volume Z-Score: (Current Volume - 20-day MA Volume)/20-day Std Dev of Volume
4. Historical percentile calculations for both metrics

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different lookback periods for percentile calculations (50-200 days)
2. Experiment with band settings (18-22 periods, 1.8-2.2 std dev)
3. Adjust volume z-score threshold between 1.5-2.5 based on asset volatility

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, avoiding prolonged trends or choppy conditions. The combination of volatility contraction and volume surge provides high-probability breakout signals.
