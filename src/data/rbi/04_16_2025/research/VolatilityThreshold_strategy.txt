STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityThreshold  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Filter:** Uses the 20-day Average True Range (ATR) to identify low-volatility conditions when it drops below its 10th percentile (historically derived).  
2. **Trend Confirmation:** Requires price to cross above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to ensure alignment with a broader uptrend.  
3. **Exit Mechanism:** Implements a dynamic stop-loss at 2x ATR below the entry price and a profit-taking signal based on a 5-day high breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The 20-day ATR must fall below its 10th percentile (calculated over a lookback period, e.g., 1 year).  
- **Condition 2:** Price must close above the 200-day SMA.  
- **Execution:** Enter a long position on the next candleâ€™s open if both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Exit the trade if price drops to 2x the current 20-day ATR below the entry price.  
- **Take-Profit:** Exit the trade if price reaches a new 5-day high (close above the highest high of the last 5 days).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop-loss to limit risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during earnings announcements or major news events that may skew volatility readings.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **20-day ATR:** To measure volatility and identify low-volatility thresholds.  
2. **200-day SMA:** To confirm the long-term trend direction.  
3. **10th Percentile ATR:** Pre-calculated historical threshold for the 20-day ATR (requires backtesting or rolling window analysis).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines mean-reversion (low ATR) with trend-following (200 SMA crossover).  
- Dynamic stop-loss adapts to current volatility, while the 5-day high exit locks in momentum.  
- Avoids choppy markets by waiting for volatility to compress significantly.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different percentiles (e.g., 5th or 15th) for the ATR threshold.  
- Experiment with SMA lengths (e.g., 100 or 50-day) for varying timeframes.  
- Adjust the stop-loss multiplier (e.g., 1.5x or 3x ATR) based on asset volatility.
