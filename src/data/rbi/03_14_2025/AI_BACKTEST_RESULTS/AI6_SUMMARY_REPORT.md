### Performance Comparison
| Strategy | Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate | Trades | Best Feature |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| **DivergenceVolatility** | **+2.61%** | **1.84** | **-0.87%** | **44.00%** | 125 | Volume confirmation |
| DivergenceBand | +1.05% | 0.21 | -4.89% | 40.00% | 10 | RSI filtering |
| DivergenceAnchor | -9.28% | -0.81 | -9.32% | 29.41% | 17 | Conservative entries |

## Technical Analysis Insights

### Best Performing Strategy: DivergenceVolatility 🏆
**Why it succeeded:**
- **Volume Confirmation**: 50% volume spike requirement filtered out weak signals
- **Volatility Adaptation**: ATR-based entries and exits adapted to market conditions
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Highest Sharpe ratio (1.84) with lowest max drawdown (-0.87%)
- **Trade Frequency**: 125 trades provided statistical significance

### Strategy Improvements Identified:
1. **DivergenceAnchor**: Bearish divergence logic needs refinement for bull market conditions
2. **DivergenceBand**: RSI oversold condition too restrictive, missed opportunities
3. **DivergenceVolatility**: Optimal balance of confirmation filters and trade frequency
