STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityHarvester

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityHarvester strategy is a specialized options trading approach designed to capitalize on morning market volatility and specific VIX conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - **Time Window**: Focuses exclusively on morning trading hours (9am-11am) when market volatility is typically higher.
   - **Open Interest Analysis**: Requires lower open interest compared to the previous day's close, indicating reduced liquidity and potential for price swings.
   - **VIX Condition**: Only activates when VIX futures are above 20, signaling elevated market fear and potential for increased option premiums.
   - **Option Type**: Specifically targets selling put options, benefiting from time decay and volatility contraction.

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - Monitor open interest levels at market open.
   - Confirm VIX futures are above 20.
   - Execute a limit order to sell put options during the 9am-11am window.
   - Choose strike prices based on your risk tolerance and market analysis.

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - Set a limit order at expiration to automatically close the position and lock in profits.
   - Consider early exit if VIX drops significantly below 20 or if open interest spikes unexpectedly.
   - Implement a stop-loss mechanism if the underlying asset moves against your position beyond a predetermined threshold.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Position sizing should be conservative, typically no more than 2-3% of total capital per trade.
   - Maintain adequate margin requirements for selling puts.
   - Diversify across different underlying assets to spread risk.
   - Monitor the Greeks, particularly Delta and Vega, to understand your position's sensitivity to price and volatility changes.

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - Real-time VIX futures data
   - Open interest tracking tools
   - Options chain analysis platform
   - Volatility surface analysis
   - Greeks calculator

This strategy requires careful monitoring of market conditions and disciplined execution. It's particularly suited for traders with experience in options trading and a solid understanding of volatility dynamics. Always backtest your approach and paper trade before committing real capital.
