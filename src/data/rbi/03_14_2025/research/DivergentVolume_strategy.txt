STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentVolume

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentVolume strategy is a unique approach that combines RSI divergence analysis with volume confirmation and ATR-based exits. It focuses on identifying bearish RSI divergences during uptrends while incorporating volume dynamics and volatility-based exit signals.

Key Strategy Components:
1. RSI Divergence Detection (14-period RSI)
2. Price Action Confirmation (Higher Highs)
3. Volume Analysis (Decreasing volume)
4. ATR-based Exit Levels (14-period ATR)

Entry Rules:
1. Identify a bearish RSI divergence:
   - Price makes a higher high
   - RSI makes a lower high
2. Confirm decreasing volume:
   - Current volume is lower than previous volume peak
3. Enter long position when:
   - Both divergence and volume conditions are met
   - Price closes above the previous high

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit:
   - When RSI converges (current RSI > previous RSI high)
2. Secondary Exit:
   - When price reaches 1.5x ATR above entry
3. Stop Loss:
   - Set at 1x ATR below entry

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum portfolio exposure: 5%
3. Daily trade limit: 3 trades
4. Stop loss mandatory on all positions

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14-period)
2. ATR (14-period)
3. Volume indicator

Additional Notes:
- Only trade during high liquidity hours
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Confirm divergence on 1-hour chart before executing on lower timeframes
- Use volume moving average (20-period) to confirm decreasing volume trend

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on market volatility
- Consider adding MACD confirmation for stronger signals
- Test different RSI periods for specific instruments
- Implement time-based exits for longer-term trades

This strategy combines technical analysis with volume dynamics, offering a systematic approach to trading bearish divergences in uptrends while managing risk through volatility-based exits.
