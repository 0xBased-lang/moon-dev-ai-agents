STRATEGY_NAME: InverseMidpoint

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The InverseMidpoint strategy is designed to capitalize on bearish market conditions by utilizing 2x leveraged inverse ETFs. The strategy focuses on identifying potential downtrends by analyzing price action relative to the previous day's trading range and volume activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **2x Leveraged Inverse ETFs**: The strategy uses ETFs that provide 2x inverse exposure to the underlying index or asset, amplifying returns during downtrends.
2. **Midpoint Analysis**: The midpoint of the previous day's open-high range is calculated as a key reference level for identifying bearish setups.
3. **Volume Filter**: A volume threshold is used to confirm the strength of the bearish signal, ensuring trades are taken only during high-activity periods.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Condition 1**: The closing price of the ETF must be below the midpoint of the previous day's open-high range. The midpoint is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Midpoint} = \frac{\text{Previous Day's Open} + \text{Previous Day's High}}{2}
   \]
2. **Condition 2**: The trading volume on the current day must exceed 10% of the average daily trading volume (calculated over a specified lookback period, e.g., 20 days).
3. **Action**: If both conditions are met, enter a long position in the 2x leveraged inverse ETF.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Condition 1**: Exit the position if the closing price of the ETF rises above the midpoint of the previous day's open-high range.
2. **Condition 2**: Exit the position if the volume drops below the 10% threshold of the average daily trading volume.
3. **Action**: Close the position immediately if either condition is met.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Allocate a fixed percentage of the portfolio to each trade (e.g., 2-5%) to limit exposure to any single position.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Consider implementing a stop-loss order at a predefined percentage below the entry price (e.g., 5-10%) to protect against unexpected reversals.
3. **Leverage Awareness**: Be cautious of the amplified risk associated with leveraged ETFs, as they can lead to significant losses during volatile market conditions.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Price Data**: Daily open, high, low, and close prices for the ETF.
2. **Volume Data**: Daily trading volume for the ETF.
3. **Average Daily Volume**: A rolling average of daily trading volume (e.g., 20-day average).
4. **Midpoint Calculation**: A custom indicator to calculate the midpoint of the previous day's open-high range.

### Additional Notes:
- **Timeframe**: This strategy is best suited for daily charts and short- to medium-term trading.
- **Market Conditions**: Works best in trending or volatile markets. Avoid using this strategy during sideways or choppy market conditions.
- **Backtesting**: Always backtest the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance and refine parameters before live trading.

By focusing on the midpoint of the previous day's range and incorporating a volume filter, the InverseMidpoint strategy aims to identify high-probability bearish setups while managing risk effectively.
