STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Strategy Components:
1. **Momentum-Contrarian Approach**: Combines momentum (using RSI) and contrarian signals (using VIX) to identify potential long entries during periods of high RSI and low VIX.
2. **Volatility Analysis**: Utilizes the VIX (Volatility Index) as a key indicator to gauge market fear and complacency.
3. **Price Correlation**: Exits are determined by the correlation between the VIX and a 200-day moving average of price action, ensuring alignment with long-term trends.

Entry Rules:
1. **RSI Condition**: Enter a long position when the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is above 70, indicating overbought conditions and strong upward momentum.
2. **VIX Condition**: Simultaneously, the VIX must be below a predefined threshold (e.g., 15), signaling low market volatility and complacency.
3. **Confirmation**: Ensure the price is above the 200-day moving average to confirm the bullish trend.

Exit Rules:
1. **VIX-Price Correlation**: Exit the long position when the correlation between the VIX and the 200-day moving average of price action becomes negative, indicating a potential reversal or weakening trend.
2. **RSI Reversal**: Alternatively, exit if the RSI drops below 50, signaling a loss of upward momentum.
3. **Stop-Loss**: Implement a stop-loss at a predefined percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below the entry price to manage downside risk.

Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of the portfolio (e.g., 2-3%) per trade to limit exposure.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Always set a stop-loss to protect against unexpected market moves.
3. **Diversification**: Avoid overconcentration in a single asset or sector to spread risk.

Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: To identify overbought conditions and momentum.
2. **VIX (Volatility Index)**: To gauge market volatility and sentiment.
3. **200-Day Moving Average**: To confirm the long-term trend and assist in exit decisions.
4. **Correlation Analysis Tool**: To measure the relationship between the VIX and the 200-day moving average of price action.

This strategy leverages the interplay between momentum, volatility, and long-term trends to identify high-probability long entries while managing risk through careful exit criteria and position sizing.
