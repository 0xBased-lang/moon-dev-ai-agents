STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityBreakout strategy is designed to capitalize on strong uptrends by identifying breakout opportunities using Bollinger Bands, volume analysis, and RSI divergence. The strategy focuses on high-probability entries during periods of increased volatility and momentum, with exits determined by ATR-based volatility bounds.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bollinger Bands: Used to identify price breakouts above the upper band, signaling strong upward momentum.
2. Volume Analysis: Confirms the strength of the breakout with above-average trading volume.
3. RSI Divergence: Identifies bullish momentum divergence to confirm the strength of the trend.
4. ATR (Average True Range): Sets dynamic exit points based on market volatility.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to break above the upper Bollinger Band.
2. Confirm the breakout with above-average trading volume (e.g., volume > 20-period SMA of volume).
3. Validate the setup with bullish RSI divergence (price making higher lows while RSI makes higher lows).
4. Enter a long position when all three conditions are met.

Exit Rules:
1. Calculate ATR-based volatility bounds:
   - Upper Bound: Entry Price + (2 * ATR)
   - Lower Bound: Entry Price - (1 * ATR)
2. Take profit at the Upper Bound.
3. Set stop-loss at the Lower Bound.
4. Exit immediately if price closes below the middle Bollinger Band.

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade.
2. Use ATR-based stop-loss to adapt to market volatility.
3. Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic events.
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account equity.

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume (20-period SMA for comparison)
3. RSI (14-period)
4. ATR (14-period)

Additional Notes:
- This strategy performs best in trending markets and may produce false signals during choppy or range-bound conditions.
- Consider using a time filter (e.g., only trade during the first 4 hours of the session) to focus on the most liquid market periods.
- Backtest the strategy on your specific market and timeframe to optimize parameters.

The VolatilityBreakout strategy combines technical indicators with volume and volatility analysis to create a systematic approach for capturing strong trending moves while managing risk effectively.
