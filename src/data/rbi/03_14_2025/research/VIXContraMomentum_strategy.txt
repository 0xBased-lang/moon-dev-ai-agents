STRATEGY_NAME: VIXContraMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VIXContraMomentum strategy is a unique approach that combines momentum and contrarian principles by analyzing the shape of VIX futures movements. It capitalizes on the psychological shifts in market sentiment reflected by the VIX, using its "V" and inverted "V" patterns to identify potential reversals in market volatility and price trends.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **VIX Futures Analysis**: The strategy focuses on the shape of VIX futures movements, specifically looking for "V" and inverted "V" patterns.
2. **Momentum-Contrarian Hybrid**: It combines momentum (following the initial trend) and contrarian (betting on the reversal) principles.
3. **Market Sentiment Indicator**: VIX futures act as a proxy for market fear and complacency, providing insights into potential market reversals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Look for a "V" shape in VIX futures, characterized by:
     - An initial upward movement (increasing VIX, indicating rising fear).
     - Followed by a downward movement (decreasing VIX, indicating fear subsiding).
   - Enter a long position in the underlying asset (e.g., S&P 500) when the VIX futures complete the downward leg of the "V" shape.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Look for an inverted "V" shape in VIX futures, characterized by:
     - An initial downward movement (decreasing VIX, indicating complacency).
     - Followed by an upward movement (increasing VIX, indicating fear returning).
   - Enter a short position in the underlying asset when the VIX futures complete the upward leg of the inverted "V" shape.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Long Exit**:
   - Exit the long position when the VIX futures start to rise again, indicating a potential return of fear.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop-loss or a predefined profit target based on historical volatility.

2. **Short Exit**:
   - Exit the short position when the VIX futures start to decline again, indicating a potential return of complacency.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop-loss or a predefined profit target.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to manage risk.
2. **Stop-Loss**:
   - Set a stop-loss based on the volatility of the underlying asset (e.g., 1x ATR or a percentage of the asset's price).
3. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid overconcentration in a single asset or sector. Consider applying the strategy across multiple correlated assets (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ).

### Required Indicators:
1. **VIX Futures Chart**:
   - Use a candlestick or line chart to identify "V" and inverted "V" patterns.
2. **Underlying Asset Chart**:
   - Monitor the price action of the asset you are trading (e.g., S&P 500 index or ETF).
3. **Volatility Indicators (Optional)**:
   - Use ATR (Average True Range) or Bollinger Bands to gauge the volatility of the underlying asset and set stop-loss levels.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or volatile markets where VIX movements are pronounced.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to validate its effectiveness and refine entry/exit rules.
- Be cautious of false signals during low-volatility periods or when VIX movements are erratic.

By combining the predictive power of VIX futures patterns with a disciplined risk management approach, the VIXContraMomentum strategy offers a unique way to trade market sentiment shifts.
