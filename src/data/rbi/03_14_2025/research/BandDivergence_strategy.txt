STRATEGY_NAME: BandDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandDivergence strategy combines Bollinger Bands (BB) midpoints and MACD divergence to identify high-probability trend-based entries. It focuses on capturing momentum shifts by analyzing the relationship between price action, volatility, and trend strength.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands (BB):**
   - Use a 20-period BB with 2 standard deviations.
   - Focus on the midpoint (20-period SMA) as a key reference level.
   - Monitor BB width (volatility) for tightening or expansion.

2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**
   - Use standard settings (12, 26, 9).
   - Pay attention to the MACD line relative to its midpoint (zero line).
   - Look for divergence between MACD and price action.

3. **Trend Identification:**
   - Uptrend: Higher highs and higher lows in price, with MACD above the midpoint.
   - Downtrend: Lower highs and lower lows in price, with MACD below the midpoint.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry:**
   - BB midpoint opens higher (indicating upward momentum).
   - MACD is above its midpoint (confirming bullish trend strength).
   - Price is in an uptrend (higher highs and higher lows).
   - Enter long when these conditions align.

2. **Short Entry:**
   - BB midpoint tightens (indicating potential volatility contraction).
   - MACD is below its midpoint (confirming bearish trend strength).
   - Price is in a downtrend (lower highs and lower lows).
   - Enter short when these conditions align.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Long Exit:**
   - MACD crosses below its midpoint.
   - BB midpoint starts to flatten or decline.
   - Price breaks below a recent swing low.

2. **Short Exit:**
   - MACD crosses above its midpoint.
   - BB midpoint starts to flatten or rise.
   - Price breaks above a recent swing high.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop Loss:**
   - Place stop loss below the recent swing low for long trades.
   - Place stop loss above the recent swing high for short trades.
   - Use 1.5x the average true range (ATR) for dynamic stop placement.

2. **Position Sizing:**
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on stop loss distance.

3. **Take Profit:**
   - Use a 2:1 or 3:1 risk-reward ratio.
   - Consider trailing stops to lock in profits during strong trends.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2):**
   - Midpoint (20-period SMA) for trend direction.
   - Band width for volatility analysis.

2. **MACD (12, 26, 9):**
   - MACD line and signal line for divergence and trend strength.
   - Midpoint (zero line) for confirmation.

3. **Optional: ATR (14):**
   - For dynamic stop loss placement.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets. Avoid using it during choppy or sideways conditions.
- Combine with higher timeframes (e.g., daily or 4-hour) for stronger trend confirmation.
- Backtest thoroughly to optimize parameters for your specific trading instrument.

The BandDivergence strategy is designed to capitalize on trend strength and volatility shifts, providing clear entry and exit signals while maintaining disciplined risk management.
