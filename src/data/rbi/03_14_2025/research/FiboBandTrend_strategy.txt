STRATEGY_NAME: FiboBandTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FiboBandTrend strategy is a sophisticated trend-following approach that combines Fibonacci retracement levels with Bollinger Bands to identify high-probability entry and exit points. This strategy is designed to capitalize on strong trending markets while minimizing false signals through the convergence of these two powerful technical tools.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Fibonacci Retracement Levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
3. Price Action Confirmation
4. Trend Direction Filter

Entry Rules:
1. Identify the prevailing trend using a higher timeframe (e.g., daily chart)
2. Draw Fibonacci retracement levels from the most recent swing high to swing low in an uptrend, or swing low to swing high in a downtrend
3. Wait for price to retrace to one of the key Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%)
4. Confirm the entry when:
   - Price touches or crosses the lower Bollinger Band in an uptrend
   - Price touches or crosses the upper Bollinger Band in a downtrend
5. Enter the trade when price closes beyond the Bollinger Band in the direction of the trend

Exit Rules:
1. Set initial take-profit at the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2% or 161.8%)
2. Use the opposite Bollinger Band as a trailing stop
3. Exit the trade when:
   - Price reaches the take-profit level
   - Price closes beyond the opposite Bollinger Band
   - Price shows strong reversal signals at key Fibonacci levels

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss placed just beyond the most recent swing point
3. Risk-reward ratio minimum of 1:2
4. Use Bollinger Band width as volatility filter (avoid trading when bands are too narrow)

Required Indicators:
1. Fibonacci Retracement Tool
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
3. Optional: Volume indicator for confirmation

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear higher highs and higher lows (or lower highs and lower lows)
- Avoid trading during periods of low volatility when Bollinger Bands are contracting
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher timeframes to confirm the overall market trend
- Use multiple timeframes for better confirmation (e.g., 4-hour for trend direction, 1-hour for entries)

The FiboBandTrend strategy provides a systematic approach to trading trends by combining the precision of Fibonacci levels with the dynamic support/resistance of Bollinger Bands, creating a powerful confluence of technical factors for high-probability trading opportunities.
