STRATEGY_NAME: EuroSpreadScalper

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The EuroSpreadScalper is a high-frequency options trading strategy designed to capitalize on short-term price movements during the European trading session. This strategy focuses on selling put spreads at the open of European trading hours, aiming for quick profits or losses within a 30-minute window. The strategy is particularly suited for traders who prefer a disciplined, time-bound approach with clear risk management rules.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Timing**: Execute trades at the open of European trading hours (typically 8:00 AM GMT).
2. **Instrument**: Sell put spreads (a bearish options strategy involving selling a higher strike put and buying a lower strike put).
3. **Profit Target**: Aim for a 50% profit on the premium received from selling the spread.
4. **Time Frame**: Close the position within 30 minutes, regardless of profit or loss.
5. **Risk Management**: Use a stop-loss set at the strike price of the covered call option plus 1 pip.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Market Condition**: Ensure the market is liquid and volatile enough to provide sufficient movement within the 30-minute window.
2. **Spread Selection**: Choose put spreads with strikes that are out-of-the-money (OTM) but not too far from the current price to ensure premium capture.
3. **Execution**: Sell the put spread at the open of European trading hours.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Close the position when 50% of the premium received is achieved.
2. **Time Limit**: Close the position after 30 minutes if the profit target is not met.
3. **Stop-Loss**: Exit the trade if the price moves against the position, reaching the stop-loss level (strike price of the covered call option plus 1 pip).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Limit the size of each trade to a small percentage of the total trading capital to manage risk.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Strictly adhere to the stop-loss rule to prevent large losses.
3. **Diversification**: Avoid concentrating all trades in a single underlying asset to spread risk.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Volatility Index (VIX)**: Monitor implied volatility to ensure favorable conditions for selling options.
2. **Price Action**: Use real-time price action to gauge market direction and momentum.
3. **Economic Calendar**: Be aware of major economic announcements during the European session that could impact market volatility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Liquidity**: Ensure the underlying asset has sufficient liquidity to facilitate quick entry and exit.
- **Broker Requirements**: Verify that your broker allows for quick execution and tight spreads, essential for this high-frequency strategy.
- **Backtesting**: Conduct thorough backtesting to validate the strategy's effectiveness under various market conditions.

By adhering to these rules and maintaining discipline, the EuroSpreadScalper can be a powerful tool for traders looking to exploit short-term opportunities in the European trading session.
