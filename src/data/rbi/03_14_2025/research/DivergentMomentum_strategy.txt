STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This strategy combines momentum filtering, divergence detection, and directional bias analysis to identify high-probability long entries and exits. The core idea is to capitalize on oversold conditions with bullish divergence while using the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) to manage exits.

### Key Components:
1. **Momentum Filter**: Uses RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify oversold conditions (RSI < 30).
2. **Divergence Detection**: Looks for bullish divergence between the RSI and the 50-period Moving Average (MA).
3. **Exit Mechanism**: Relies on the CCI's directional bias to determine when to exit the trade.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Condition 1**: The short-term RSI (default 14-period) must be below 30, indicating an oversold condition.
2. **Condition 2**: The RSI must show bullish divergence relative to the 50-period MA. This means the RSI is making higher lows while the price is making lower lows.
3. **Confirmation**: Wait for the price to close above the 50-period MA to confirm the bullish reversal.

### Exit Rules:
1. **CCI Directional Bias**: Monitor the CCI (default 20-period) for a change in direction. Exit the trade when the CCI starts to turn downward after reaching overbought levels (CCI > 100).
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss below the most recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) below the entry price.
3. **Take Profit**: Use a trailing stop or exit when the CCI crosses below a predefined threshold (e.g., 0 or -50).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
2. **Stop Loss**: Always use a stop loss to limit downside risk.
3. **Trailing Stop**: Consider using a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: 14-period (default) to identify oversold conditions and divergence.
2. **50-period Moving Average (MA)**: Used to confirm the bullish reversal and divergence.
3. **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)**: 20-period (default) to determine exit points based on directional bias.

---

### Example Setup:
1. **Entry**: RSI drops below 30, forms a higher low while price forms a lower low, and the price closes above the 50-period MA.
2. **Exit**: CCI reaches overbought levels (>100) and starts to turn downward.
3. **Stop Loss**: Set below the recent swing low or 1-2% below the entry price.

This strategy is designed for trending markets and works best when combined with proper risk management and confirmation from price action.
