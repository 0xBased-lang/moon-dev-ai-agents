STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityMomentum strategy is a momentum-based approach that leverages Bollinger Bands and the Average True Range (ATR) to identify high-volatility entry opportunities, combined with RSI crossovers for precise exits. This strategy is designed to capitalize on strong price movements while managing risk through volatility-based entry filters and momentum-based exits.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands**: Used to measure volatility by calculating the standard deviation of price over a specified period (typically 20 periods). The upper and lower bands represent dynamic support and resistance levels.
2. **Average True Range (ATR)**: Measures market volatility by calculating the average range of price movement over a specified period (typically 14 periods).
3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: A momentum oscillator used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, with a focus on 50-bar crossovers for exit signals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volatility Filter**: Calculate the difference between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands' standard deviations. This difference represents the current volatility spread.
2. **ATR Comparison**: Compare the volatility spread to the ATR. If the volatility spread exceeds the ATR, it indicates a high-volatility environment conducive to momentum trading.
3. **Long Entry**: Enter a long position when the volatility spread exceeds the ATR, signaling a potential breakout or strong trend continuation.

### Exit Rules:
1. **RSI Crossover**: Monitor the 50-bar RSI. Exit the long position when the RSI crosses below 50, indicating a loss of momentum or a potential reversal.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Optionally, set a stop-loss based on a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR) to manage risk in case of adverse price movements.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to ensure consistent risk exposure.
2. **Volatility Filter**: The ATR comparison ensures entries are only taken during high-volatility periods, reducing the likelihood of false breakouts.
3. **RSI Exit**: The 50-bar RSI crossover provides a systematic way to exit trades when momentum wanes, locking in profits and minimizing losses.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. **Average True Range (ATR)** (14-period)
3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** (50-bar)

### Summary:
The VolatilityMomentum strategy combines volatility analysis with momentum-based exits to identify high-probability trading opportunities. By focusing on periods of high volatility and using RSI crossovers for exits, this strategy aims to capture strong trends while minimizing exposure to low-momentum or choppy market conditions. Proper risk management, including position sizing and stop-loss placement, is essential to maximize the strategy's effectiveness.
