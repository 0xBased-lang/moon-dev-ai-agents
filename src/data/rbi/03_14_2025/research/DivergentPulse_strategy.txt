STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentPulse strategy is a trend-reversal trading system that combines MACD and RSI divergence signals for precise entry points, while using ATR-based exits and strict daily trade limits for disciplined risk management.

Key Components:
1. MACD Divergence: Identifies potential trend reversals when price makes higher highs while MACD makes lower highs (bearish divergence) or price makes lower lows while MACD makes higher lows (bullish divergence).
2. RSI Divergence: Confirms reversal signals when RSI shows divergence in the same direction as MACD.
3. ATR-based Exits: Uses 2-3 ATR units from entry price as dynamic profit targets and stop-loss levels.
4. Daily Trade Limit: Restricts trading to one position per day to prevent overtrading.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for both MACD and RSI to show divergence in the same direction (bullish or bearish).
2. For bullish trades:
   - Price makes lower low
   - MACD makes higher low
   - RSI makes higher low
3. For bearish trades:
   - Price makes higher high
   - MACD makes lower high
   - RSI makes lower high
4. Enter on the first candle that closes in the direction of the divergence after confirmation.

Exit Rules:
1. Set profit target at 2-3 ATR units from entry price in the trade direction.
2. Set stop-loss at 2-3 ATR units from entry price in the opposite direction.
3. Exit immediately if either target or stop is hit.
4. Close any open position at market close if not triggered.

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated based on 1% risk per trade using ATR-based stop distance.
2. Maximum one trade per day, regardless of outcome.
3. No trading during major news events or low liquidity periods.
4. Daily loss limit of 3% of account equity.

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12,26,9) - for divergence detection
2. RSI (14) - for confirmation and divergence
3. ATR (14) - for position sizing and exit levels
4. Price chart with visible swing highs/lows

Additional Notes:
- Use 1-hour or 4-hour charts for optimal signal quality.
- Backtest on at least 6 months of historical data before live trading.
- Keep a trading journal to track divergence patterns and their success rates.
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups.

This strategy combines the power of momentum divergence with volatility-based exits, creating a systematic approach to catching trend reversals while maintaining strict risk control. The daily trade limit ensures discipline and prevents emotional trading decisions.
