STRATEGY_NAME: InverseVolumeDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The InverseVolumeDivergence strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines volume analysis, candlestick patterns, and dual divergence signals from RSI and Stochastic Oscillator to identify high-probability reversal opportunities. This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets where volume and momentum divergences often precede reversals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Inverse Volume Breakdown**: Focuses on identifying volume patterns that contradict the current price trend, signaling potential exhaustion.
2. **Candlestick Patterns**: Uses specific reversal candlestick patterns (e.g., Doji, Engulfing, Hammer) to confirm potential reversals.
3. **RSI Divergence**: Detects divergence between RSI and price action to identify weakening momentum.
4. **Stochastic Oscillator Divergence**: Confirms divergence signals with the Stochastic Oscillator, adding an additional layer of confirmation.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volume Confirmation**: Look for a significant decrease in volume during an uptrend or an increase in volume during a downtrend (inverse volume behavior).
2. **Candlestick Reversal Pattern**: Identify a valid reversal candlestick pattern (e.g., Bearish Engulfing in an uptrend or Bullish Engulfing in a downtrend).
3. **RSI Divergence**: Confirm bearish divergence (price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs) in an uptrend or bullish divergence (price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows) in a downtrend.
4. **Stochastic Divergence**: Confirm the same divergence pattern on the Stochastic Oscillator (e.g., %K line diverging from price action).
5. **Entry Trigger**: Enter a short position in an uptrend or a long position in a downtrend when all conditions align.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) based on the stop-loss distance.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Place the stop-loss above the recent swing high (for short positions) or below the recent swing low (for long positions).
3. **Trailing Stop**: Optionally, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.
4. **Exit on Divergence Reversal**: Exit the trade if the RSI or Stochastic Oscillator shows a reversal of the divergence pattern.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
2. **Stop-Loss Placement**: Ensure the stop-loss is placed at a logical level based on recent price action.
3. **Avoid Overtrading**: Only take trades that meet all criteria to maintain a high win rate.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Volume Indicator**: To analyze volume patterns and confirm inverse volume behavior.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Set to a 14-period default for divergence analysis.
3. **Stochastic Oscillator**: Set to 14, 3, 3 for %K, %D, and smoothing parameters.
4. **Candlestick Patterns**: Use built-in candlestick pattern recognition tools or manual identification.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to reduce noise and false signals.
- Combine this strategy with fundamental analysis or market context (e.g., key support/resistance levels) for better accuracy.
- Backtest thoroughly on historical data to optimize parameters and confirm performance.

By combining inverse volume behavior, candlestick patterns, and dual divergence signals, the InverseVolumeDivergence strategy provides a robust framework for identifying high-probability reversal trades.
