STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricFibMACD

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricFibMACD strategy is a sophisticated trend-following approach that combines MACD signal line crossovers, Fibonacci retracement levels, volume analysis, and ATR-based volatility filters to identify high-probability trade setups. This strategy is designed to capture strong trending moves while filtering out low-volatility or low-volume conditions.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **MACD Signal Line Crossover**: Uses the MACD oscillator's signal line crossing above/below its 26-period EMA to identify potential trend direction.
2. **Fibonacci Retracement Confirmation**: Requires price to retrace to the 0.382 Fibonacci level to confirm the trend continuation.
3. **Volume Filter**: Ensures trades are only taken when volume increases, indicating strong participation.
4. **ATR Volatility Filter**: Uses ATR multiples to confirm increased volatility, ensuring trades are taken only in high-volatility environments.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - MACD signal line crosses above its 26-period EMA.
   - Price retraces to the 0.382 Fibonacci level.
   - Volume increases compared to the previous period.
   - ATR multiple indicates increased volatility (e.g., ATR > 1.5x its average).
2. **Short Entry**:
   - MACD signal line crosses below its 26-period EMA.
   - Price retraces to the 0.382 Fibonacci level.
   - Volume increases compared to the previous period.
   - ATR multiple indicates increased volatility (e.g., ATR > 1.5x its average).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Exit when price reaches the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 0.618 or 1.0).
   - Alternatively, exit when the MACD signal line crosses back below/above its 26-period EMA.
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss below the 0.618 Fibonacci level for long trades or above it for short trades.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on ATR (e.g., 2x ATR).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).
2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio.
3. **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trades when ATR is below its average, indicating low volatility.

### Required Indicators:
1. **MACD (12, 26, 9)**:
   - Fast EMA: 12
   - Slow EMA: 26
   - Signal Line: 9
2. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
   - Key levels: 0.382, 0.618
3. **Volume Indicator**:
   - Compare current volume to previous period.
4. **ATR (14)**:
   - Period: 14
   - Use multiples (e.g., 1.5x) to confirm volatility.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.
- Always backtest on historical data to optimize parameters (e.g., ATR multiples, Fibonacci levels).
- Combine with fundamental analysis or news events to avoid trading during low-liquidity periods.

By combining these elements, the VolumetricFibMACD strategy provides a robust framework for identifying high-probability trend-following opportunities while minimizing risk in low-volatility or low-volume environments.
