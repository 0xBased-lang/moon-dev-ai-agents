STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilitySurge strategy is designed to capitalize on significant price movements following periods of low volatility. It uses a combination of volatility measurements and breakout levels to identify high-probability trading opportunities. The strategy is particularly effective in trending markets and during periods of increased market activity.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volatility Measurement**: Uses the Average True Range (ATR) to gauge market volatility.
2. **Breakout Levels**: Establishes dynamic support and resistance levels based on recent price action and volatility.
3. **Trend Confirmation**: Utilizes a moving average (e.g., 50-period SMA) to confirm the overall trend direction.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volatility Threshold**: Wait for the ATR to drop below a predefined threshold (e.g., 1% of the asset's price), indicating a period of low volatility.
2. **Breakout Confirmation**: Enter a long position when the price breaks above the upper breakout level (calculated as the highest high of the last N periods + ATR multiplier). Enter a short position when the price breaks below the lower breakout level (calculated as the lowest low of the last N periods - ATR multiplier).
3. **Trend Alignment**: Ensure the breakout aligns with the overall trend direction (e.g., price above the 50-period SMA for long trades, below for short trades).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Set a profit target based on a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 2x ATR).
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss at the opposite breakout level or a fixed percentage below/above the entry price.
3. **Trailing Stop**: Use a trailing stop based on the ATR to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Limit risk per trade to a small percentage of your total capital (e.g., 1-2%).
2. **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading during periods of extremely high volatility, as breakouts may be less reliable.
3. **Diversification**: Spread trades across multiple assets or markets to reduce exposure to any single trade.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Average True Range (ATR)**: To measure volatility and set breakout levels.
2. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: To confirm the trend direction.
3. **Price Action**: To identify recent highs and lows for breakout level calculations.

The VolatilitySurge strategy is ideal for traders who prefer a systematic approach to capturing significant price movements while managing risk effectively. It works best in markets with clear trends and periodic volatility contractions.
