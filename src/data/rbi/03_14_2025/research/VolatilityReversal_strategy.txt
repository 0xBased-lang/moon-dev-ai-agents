STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityReversal strategy combines multiple technical indicators to identify high-probability trend reversal opportunities during periods of increased market volatility. This strategy focuses on catching reversals when the market is oversold and volatility is expanding, with clear exit signals based on price action and volatility expansion.

Key Components:
1. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - For trend reversal signals
2. Bollinger Bands - To measure volatility and identify potential breakout points
3. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - To identify oversold conditions
4. Price Channel - For exit signals
5. ATR (Average True Range) - For volatility-based exits

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for MACD to show a bullish crossover (signal line crosses above MACD line)
2. Confirm Bollinger Bands are expanding (indicating increased volatility)
3. RSI must be below 30 (oversold condition)
4. Price should be near or below the lower Bollinger Band
5. All three conditions must align for a valid entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price breaks above the upper boundary of the established price channel
2. Secondary Exit: When ATR shows significant expansion (e.g., 1.5x the average ATR value)
3. Stop Loss: Set below the recent swing low or below the lower Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Use trailing stops once price moves in favor
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account
4. Avoid trading during major news events
5. Implement a maximum drawdown limit of 15%

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12,26,9 standard settings)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard settings)
3. RSI (14 period)
4. ATR (14 period)
5. Price Channel (customizable period based on market conditions)

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear volatility cycles
- Backtest on multiple timeframes to find optimal settings
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability trades
- Monitor volume to confirm reversal signals
- Adjust parameters based on market conditions and asset class

Optimization Tips:
- Test different RSI thresholds (25-35)
- Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (14-20)
- Adjust MACD settings for different timeframes
- Use multiple time frame analysis for confirmation
- Consider adding volume indicators for additional confirmation

This strategy is particularly effective in volatile markets where price tends to revert to the mean after extreme moves. The combination of trend, momentum, and volatility indicators provides a robust framework for identifying high-probability reversal opportunities while managing risk effectively.
