STRATEGY_NAME: FibroMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroMomentum strategy combines Fibonacci retracement levels with momentum indicators to identify potential reversal points after a downtrend. The strategy focuses on entering long positions when price action aligns with key Fibonacci levels and is supported by bearish momentum confirmation. Exits are managed using ATR-based percentage stops or RSI divergence signals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: Use Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) to identify potential support zones after a downtrend.
2. **Momentum Indicators**: Use bearish momentum indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) to confirm the strength of the downtrend and potential reversal.
3. **ATR Percentage Stop**: Use the Average True Range (ATR) to set a dynamic stop-loss based on market volatility.
4. **RSI Divergence**: Monitor RSI for bullish divergence as an exit signal.

### Entry Rules:
1. Identify a clear downtrend using price action or trend indicators.
2. Draw Fibonacci retracement levels from the recent swing high to the swing low.
3. Wait for the price to reach a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%).
4. Confirm bearish momentum using RSI (below 50) or MACD (bearish crossover).
5. Enter a long position when price action shows signs of reversal (e.g., bullish candlestick patterns) at the Fibonacci level.

### Exit Rules:
1. **ATR Percentage Stop**: Set a stop-loss at 1.5x the ATR value below the entry price.
2. **RSI Divergence Exit**: Exit the trade if RSI shows bullish divergence (price makes a lower low while RSI makes a higher low).
3. Take profit at the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2% or 161.8%) or when price reaches a significant resistance level.

### Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading account per trade.
2. Use the ATR-based stop-loss to dynamically adjust for market volatility.
3. Avoid trading during high-impact news events or low liquidity periods.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: To identify key support levels.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: To confirm bearish momentum and identify divergence.
3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Optional for additional momentum confirmation.
4. **ATR (Average True Range)**: To set dynamic stop-loss levels.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear price swings.
- Combine with volume analysis to confirm the strength of the reversal.
- Backtest on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to ensure consistency.

The FibroMomentum strategy is designed to capitalize on high-probability reversal setups while managing risk effectively through dynamic stop-loss and divergence-based exits.
