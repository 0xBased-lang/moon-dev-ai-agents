STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricBreakout strategy is a volume-based trading approach that leverages the Volume Oscillator to identify potential breakout opportunities. This strategy focuses on detecting significant shifts in volume momentum, which often precede price breakouts. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volume Oscillator**: The core indicator used to measure the difference between two volume moving averages (typically a short-term and a long-term moving average). This helps identify changes in volume momentum.
2. **Price Action**: The strategy monitors price levels, particularly support and resistance zones, to confirm breakouts.
3. **Breakout Confirmation**: A breakout is confirmed when the Volume Oscillator shows a significant spike in volume momentum, and price action breaks through a key level.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volume Oscillator Signal**: Look for a sharp increase in the Volume Oscillator, indicating a surge in volume momentum. This is often represented by the oscillator crossing above a predefined threshold (e.g., +0.5 or +1.0).
2. **Price Breakout**: Wait for the price to break above a resistance level (for long entries) or below a support level (for short entries).
3. **Confirmation**: Ensure the breakout is accompanied by a strong Volume Oscillator signal to validate the move.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Set a predefined profit target based on the average true range (ATR) or a fixed percentage gain (e.g., 2-3%).
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop-loss order below the breakout level (for long positions) or above the breakout level (for short positions). The stop-loss distance can be determined using ATR or a fixed percentage.
3. **Volume Oscillator Reversal**: Exit the trade if the Volume Oscillator reverses direction and crosses below the threshold, indicating a loss of momentum.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your trading capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to manage risk.
2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 to ensure profitable trades outweigh losing ones.
3. **Avoid Overtrading**: Only take trades that meet all entry criteria to maintain discipline and avoid false breakouts.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Volume Oscillator**: Calculated as the difference between a short-term (e.g., 5-period) and a long-term (e.g., 20-period) volume moving average.
2. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Identify key price levels using technical analysis tools like horizontal lines or pivot points.
3. **Average True Range (ATR)**: Optional for setting stop-loss and profit target levels based on market volatility.

### Example Setup:
- **Long Trade**: 
  - Volume Oscillator crosses above +1.0.
  - Price breaks above a resistance level.
  - Enter long with a stop-loss below the breakout level and a profit target of 2x the stop-loss distance.
- **Short Trade**:
  - Volume Oscillator crosses below -1.0.
  - Price breaks below a support level.
  - Enter short with a stop-loss above the breakout level and a profit target of 2x the stop-loss distance.

This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets where volume spikes often precede significant price movements. Always backtest and optimize the parameters (e.g., Volume Oscillator thresholds, moving average periods) to suit your specific trading instrument and timeframe.
