STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentBandReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines MACD divergence signals with Bollinger Band breakouts to identify mean-reversion opportunities. It focuses on capturing price movements when the market deviates significantly from its mean and then reverts back. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **MACD Divergence**: 
   - Used to identify potential reversals when price action diverges from MACD momentum.
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows while MACD makes higher lows.
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs while MACD makes lower highs.

2. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Used to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential breakout points.
   - The strategy focuses on breakouts beyond ±2σ (standard deviations) of the Bollinger Bands.

3. **Mean Reversion**:
   - The strategy assumes that prices will revert to the mean (middle Bollinger Band) after extreme deviations.

### **Entry Rules**
1. **Bullish Entry**:
   - MACD shows bullish divergence (price lower lows, MACD higher lows).
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band (+2σ).
   - Enter a long position when both conditions are met.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - MACD shows bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD lower highs).
   - Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band (-2σ).
   - Enter a short position when both conditions are met.

---

### **Exit Rules**
1. **Profit Target**:
   - Exit when price reverts to the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss at ±3σ of the Bollinger Bands to account for extreme volatility.

3. **Time-Based Exit**:
   - If the price does not revert to the middle band within a predefined time frame (e.g., 5-10 candles), exit the trade to avoid prolonged exposure.

---

### **Risk Management**
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to manage risk.

2. **Volatility Adjustment**:
   - Adjust position size based on Bollinger Band width. Wider bands indicate higher volatility, so reduce position size accordingly.

3. **Stop Loss Placement**:
   - Always use a stop loss at ±3σ to limit losses during unexpected price movements.

### **Required Indicators**
1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - Settings: Default (12, 26, 9) or customized based on the asset's volatility.

2. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Settings: 20-period SMA with ±2σ and ±3σ bands.

3. **Optional: RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
   - Can be used as a confirmation tool to avoid overbought/oversold conditions during divergence signals.

### **Example Scenario**
1. **Bullish Setup**:
   - Price makes a lower low, but MACD makes a higher low (bullish divergence).
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band (+2σ).
   - Enter long at the breakout point.
   - Exit when price reverts to the middle Bollinger Band.

2. **Bearish Setup**:
   - Price makes a higher high, but MACD makes a lower high (bearish divergence).
   - Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band (-2σ).
   - Enter short at the breakout point.
   - Exit when price reverts to the middle Bollinger Band.

### **Key Considerations**
- This strategy works best in ranging or mildly trending markets.
- Avoid using it during strong trending markets, as breakouts may lead to extended moves without reversion.
- Always backtest on historical data to optimize parameters for specific assets.

By combining MACD divergence with Bollinger Band breakouts, the DivergentBandReversion strategy aims to capitalize on short-term mean-reversion opportunities while managing risk effectively.
