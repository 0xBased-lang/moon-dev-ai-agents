STRATEGY_NAME: FractalVolumeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This strategy combines fractal pattern analysis with volume-driven breakout signals to identify high-probability trading opportunities. The key components of this strategy are:

1. **Fractal Pattern Identification**:
   - Use fractal indicators to identify key support and resistance levels.
   - Look for fractal patterns that indicate potential breakout zones, such as higher highs or lower lows.

2. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Monitor volume spikes to confirm breakout signals.
   - Use volume moving averages (e.g., 20-period VMA) to distinguish between normal and significant volume increases.

3. **Breakout Confirmation**:
   - Wait for price to break above resistance or below support with a significant increase in volume.
   - Use a minimum volume threshold (e.g., 1.5x the average volume) to filter out false breakouts.

4. **Entry Rules**:
   - Enter a long position when price breaks above a fractal resistance level with a volume spike.
   - Enter a short position when price breaks below a fractal support level with a volume spike.
   - Use a stop-limit order to enter the trade at the breakout level.

5. **Exit Rules**:
   - Set a take-profit target based on the next fractal resistance (for longs) or support (for shorts).
   - Use a trailing stop-loss to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.
   - Exit the trade if volume decreases significantly, indicating a loss of momentum.

6. **Risk Management**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - Place a stop-loss just below the breakout level for long trades or above the breakout level for short trades.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between the entry point and stop-loss level.

7. **Required Indicators**:
   - Fractal Indicator (e.g., Bill Williams Fractals)
   - Volume Moving Average (VMA)
   - Volume Spike Detection (custom or built-in volume threshold indicator)

8. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events.
   - Combine this strategy with a broader market trend analysis to increase the probability of success.
   - Backtest the strategy on historical data to fine-tune parameters like volume thresholds and fractal levels.

This strategy is designed to capitalize on high-volume breakouts confirmed by fractal patterns, providing a systematic approach to trading with clear entry and exit rules.
