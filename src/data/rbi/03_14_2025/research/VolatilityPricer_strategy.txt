STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityPricer

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityPricer strategy combines Bollinger Bands with Merton's Option Pricing theory to create a sophisticated volatility-based trading system. This strategy focuses on identifying low-volatility environments for entries and uses probability-weighted stop-losses and profit targets derived from option pricing principles.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands**: Used to measure volatility and identify potential entry points.
2. **Merton's Option Pricing Theory**: Applied to calculate probability-weighted stop-losses and profit targets based on the underlying asset's volatility.
3. **Volatility Threshold**: A predefined level of historical or implied volatility used to trigger entries.
4. **Divergence Detection**: Used to identify potential exits when price action diverges from expected behavior.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volatility Filter**: Enter long positions only when the asset's volatility (measured by Bollinger Band width or historical volatility) is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 20th percentile of historical volatility).
2. **Price Confirmation**: Ensure the price is trading within the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) to confirm a stable trend.
3. **Probability-Weighted Entry**: Use Merton's model to calculate the probability of the price staying within a specific range, ensuring high-probability setups.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Divergence Exit**: Exit the trade when price action diverges from the expected range, such as a sharp move outside the Bollinger Bands or a break of key support/resistance levels.
2. **Probability-Weighted Stop-Loss**: Set a stop-loss based on the probability-weighted calculation from Merton's model, typically at a level where the probability of further downside is low (e.g., 5% probability).
3. **Profit Target**: Use Merton's model to set a probability-weighted profit target, ensuring a favorable risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or higher).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Adjust position size based on the probability-weighted risk calculated from Merton's model. Higher-probability setups allow for larger positions.
2. **Volatility-Adjusted Stop-Loss**: The stop-loss is dynamically adjusted based on current volatility levels, ensuring tighter stops in low-volatility environments and wider stops in high-volatility environments.
3. **Maximum Drawdown Limit**: Set a maximum daily or weekly drawdown limit (e.g., 2% of account equity) to prevent overexposure.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)**: To measure volatility and identify entry/exit zones.
2. **Historical Volatility (HV) or Implied Volatility (IV)**: To determine the volatility threshold for entries.
3. **Merton's Option Pricing Model**: To calculate probability-weighted stop-losses and profit targets.
4. **Divergence Detection Tool**: Such as RSI or MACD, to identify potential exits.

### Example Setup:
1. **Entry**: Volatility is below the 20th percentile, price is within the middle Bollinger Band, and Merton's model indicates a high probability of the price staying within a favorable range.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Set at a level where the probability of further downside is 5% (calculated using Merton's model).
3. **Profit Target**: Set at a level where the probability of further upside is 10% (calculated using Merton's model).
4. **Exit**: Exit if price diverges sharply (e.g., breaks below the lower Bollinger Band or shows bearish divergence on RSI).

This strategy is ideal for traders who want to combine technical analysis with quantitative methods to trade low-volatility setups with high precision.
