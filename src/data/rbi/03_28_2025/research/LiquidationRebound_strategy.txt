STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationRebound  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines liquidation data analysis with Ichimoku Cloud confirmation to identify high-probability long entries in Bitcoin. The approach focuses on extreme liquidation events followed by price confirmation above a key technical level.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Threshold:** Uses 24-hour liquidation levels exceeding the 90th percentile (extreme market flush)  
2. **Ichimoku Cloud Confirmation:** Requires price to rebound AND close above the Cloud (Kumo)  
3. **Order Flow Context:** Incorporates hourly orderbook imbalance zones for stop placement  

**Entry Rules:**  
- LONG when BOTH conditions are met:  
  (1) 24h liquidation levels > 90th percentile (historical extreme)  
  (2) Price closes above Ichimoku Cloud (Tenkan/Kijun confirmed)  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take Profit: At nearest Ichimoku Cloud resistance level  
- Stop Loss: Below the most recent hourly orderbook imbalance zone  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on distance to stop level (1-2% risk per trade)  
2. Must wait for candle CLOSE above Cloud to confirm rebound  
3. Avoid entries when Cloud is excessively flat (weak trend)  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Liquidation heatmap (90th percentile threshold)  
2. Ichimoku Cloud (standard 9/26/52 settings)  
3. Orderbook imbalance detector (1h timeframe)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines derivative market extremes (liquidations) with classical technicals  
- Uses orderbook structure for precision stop placement  
- Requires both statistical extreme AND technical confirmation  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Backtest different percentile thresholds (85th-95th)  
- Test alternative confirmation (e.g., Cloud cross vs. price above)  
- Adjust stop placement based on volatility (ATR multiple)  

This strategy excels in high-volatility environments where liquidations create overextended conditions, with the Ichimoku Cloud providing trend-filtered entries. The orderbook-based stops help avoid false breakouts while respecting market structure.
