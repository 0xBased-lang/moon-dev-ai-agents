STRATEGY_NAME: ForceChannel Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the power of Elder's Force Index with Keltner Channel dynamics to identify high-probability breakout opportunities with strong momentum confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period) - Measures buying/selling pressure
2. Keltner Channels (20-period ATR, 1.5 multiplier) - Identifies volatility-based breakout levels
3. Zero line crossover - Confirms momentum shifts

Entry Rules (Long Positions):
1. Primary Condition: Price must close ABOVE the upper Keltner Channel
2. Confirmation: Force Index must cross ABOVE zero on the same candle
3. Volume Check: Entry candle should show above-average volume (recommended but not required)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Force Index crosses BELOW zero
2. Protective Stop: Place below the most recent swing low or lower Keltner Channel (whichever is closer)
3. Optional Profit Target: 2x ATR from entry point

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Minimum 1 ATR distance from entry
3. Trade Filter: Only trade when volatility (ATR) is above its 20-period average

Required Indicators:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period standard setting)
2. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 20-period ATR, 1.5 multiplier)
3. Average True Range (ATR 20) for volatility assessment
4. Volume indicator (optional but recommended)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets (confirm with ADX > 25 if desired)
- Avoid trading during consolidation (when Keltner Channels are flat)
- Most effective on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for better results

The "ForceChannel Breakout" strategy excels by requiring both volatility expansion (Keltner breakout) and momentum confirmation (Force Index crossover), creating a high-probability trading scenario with clearly defined risk parameters.
