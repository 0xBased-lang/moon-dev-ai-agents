STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiCluster Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines on-chain liquidation data with technical volatility analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during compressed market conditions.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Analysis: Uses on-chain data to identify price levels with high concentrations of liquidation orders
2. Volatility Regime Filter: Bollinger Band Width indicator to detect low volatility conditions
3. Breakout Execution: Enters trades when price breaks through identified liquidation clusters
4. Dual Exit Mechanism: Uses both volatility expansion and next liquidation zone proximity for exits

Entry Rules:
1. Confirm Bollinger Band Width is below threshold (suggested 0.5 for daily charts)
2. Identify nearest high liquidation cluster level from on-chain data
3. Enter long when price breaks above cluster high (for short positions, below cluster low)
4. Require breakout candle to close beyond cluster level for confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When Bollinger Band Width expands beyond entry threshold (volatility expansion)
2. Secondary Exit: When price approaches next significant liquidation cluster level
3. Emergency Exit: Immediate exit if price returns inside original cluster zone

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance to next liquidation cluster (risk per trade 1-2%)
2. Stop loss placed just below breakout candle low (longs) or above high (shorts)
3. Volatility-adjusted position sizing (smaller positions in lower volatility)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation) for width calculation
2. On-chain liquidation heatmap/cluster data
3. Volume indicator for breakout confirmation

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust BB Width threshold based on asset volatility (crypto vs. forex)
2. Cluster significance threshold may need backtesting (minimum liquidation value)
3. Timeframe selection affects cluster importance (daily recommended)

This strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency for explosive moves when breaking through levels where many stops are clustered, while using volatility regimes to filter high-probability setups.
