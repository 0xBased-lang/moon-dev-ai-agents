STRATEGY_NAME: FibroPullback  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Fibonacci Retracement (61.8% Level):** The strategy focuses on the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, a key level often associated with potential reversals or continuations in trending markets.  
2. **Pullback Confirmation:** Entries are triggered when price retraces to the 61.8% level, indicating a potential pullback within a broader trend.  
3. **Trend Context:** The strategy is designed to work best in trending markets (either uptrend or downtrend), where pullbacks to key Fibonacci levels offer high-probability entry points.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Identify an established uptrend (higher highs and higher lows).  
  2. Wait for price to retrace to the 61.8% Fibonacci level drawn from the recent swing low to swing high.  
  3. Enter a long position when price touches or approaches the 61.8% level, preferably with a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., hammer, engulfing) or a bounce off the level.  

- **Short Entry (if applicable):**  
  1. Identify an established downtrend (lower highs and lower lows).  
  2. Wait for price to retrace to the 61.8% Fibonacci level drawn from the recent swing high to swing low.  
  3. Enter a short position when price touches or approaches the 61.8% level, preferably with a bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., shooting star, bearish engulfing) or a rejection from the level.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Set take-profit levels at key Fibonacci extension levels (e.g., 161.8%, 261.8%) or previous swing highs/lows.  
  - Alternatively, use a trailing stop to capture extended moves.  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Place a stop-loss just below the 61.8% level (for longs) or above it (for shorts), typically beyond the 78.6% retracement level to avoid premature exits.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss Discipline:** Always use a stop-loss to limit downside risk.  
3. **Trend Filter:** Avoid trading in choppy or sideways markets; focus only on clear trends confirmed by higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool:** To identify the 61.8% retracement level.  
2. **Price Action/Candlestick Patterns:** For confirmation of reversals at the Fibonacci level.  
3. **Optional:** Moving Averages (e.g., 50EMA, 200EMA) or ADX to confirm trend strength.  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) where Fibonacci levels carry more significance.  
- Combine with volume analysis or momentum oscillators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for additional confirmation.  
- Avoid over-trading; wait for high-quality setups where price respects the 61.8% level.  

The name "FibroPullback" reflects the strategy's core focus on Fibonacci retracements (Fibro) and pullback entries (Pullback), making it distinct from generic Fibonacci-based strategies.
