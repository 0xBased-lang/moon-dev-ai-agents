STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeSynergy

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with volume validation to identify high-probability entries while using volume-adjusted money flow for exits.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-) for trend direction confirmation
2. Volume spike detection (90th percentile threshold)
3. Volume-adjusted Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) for exit signals
4. 2-day low filter for exit timing

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish momentum signal)
2. Confirmation: Current volume must be in top 10% of recent volume (90th percentile spike)
3. Both conditions must occur on same trading day

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor volume-adjusted CMF (20-period recommended)
2. Exit long position when CMF makes a 2-day low
3. Alternative exit: Consider trailing stop if CMF remains strong

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop-loss: 2x ATR(14) below entry price
2. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
3. Maximum portfolio exposure: 5-10% in similar correlated strategies

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (default 14-period)
2. Volume percentile calculation (lookback period 20-50 days)
3. Chaikin Money Flow (20-period standard)
4. Volume adjustment for CMF (multiply standard CMF by volume ratio)
5. ATR(14) for stop-loss calculation

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different lookback periods for volume percentile (20-50 days)
2. Experiment with CMF periods (14-30)
3. Consider adding filter for overall market trend
4. Volume spike threshold can be adjusted between 85-95th percentile

Unique Advantages:
1. Combines momentum and volume confirmation
2. Uses adaptive exit based on money flow deterioration
3. Volume spike filter reduces false signals
4. Works well in trending markets with participation

Potential Limitations:
1. May underperform in low-volatility, range-bound markets
2. Requires sufficient liquidity for volume signals
3. Volume spikes can sometimes indicate exhaustion rather than continuation
