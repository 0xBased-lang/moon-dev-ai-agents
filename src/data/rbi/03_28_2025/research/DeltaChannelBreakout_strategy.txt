STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaChannelBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Heikin-Ashi trend filtering with Keltner Channel breakouts during high-liquidity session overlaps, confirmed by Cumulative Delta Volume divergence for enhanced probability trades.

Key Components:
1. Timeframe Synergy: Uses 15m Heikin-Ashi candles for clean trend visualization within 2h Keltner Channel structure
2. Session Timing: Focuses specifically on NYSE-London overlap (8:00-11:30 EST) when liquidity and volatility peak
3. Volume Confirmation: Requires Cumulative Delta divergence to validate breakout strength

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger: 15m Heikin-Ashi candle closes completely outside 2h Keltner Channel
2. Confirmation: Cumulative Delta must show divergence (price making new high/low while delta fails to confirm)
3. Timing: Only valid during NYSE-London overlap hours
4. Direction: Long if above upper channel, short if below lower channel

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: 
   - Primary: When price re-enters Keltner Channel
   - Secondary: 2:1 risk-reward ratio
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Fixed: Opposite side of Keltner Channel
   - Dynamic: Recent swing high/low (whichever is closer)

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum Daily Trades: 3 (to avoid overtrading during active session)
3. Filter: Skip trades if VIX < 12 (low volatility environment)

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (15m chart)
2. Keltner Channel (2h chart, 20-period EMA, 2.5x ATR width)
3. Cumulative Delta Volume (with divergence detection)
4. Session overlap indicator (NYSE-London hours)

Special Notes:
- Works best in trending markets, may produce false signals during choppy conditions
- Requires monitoring of news events that may disrupt normal volume patterns
- Ideal for futures, forex, and liquid equities with strong session participation
