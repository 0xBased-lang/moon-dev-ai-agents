STRATEGY_NAME: VortexAccumulation  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Identifies trend direction and strength.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Measures volume-weighted accumulation/distribution to confirm divergence.  
3. **Trend Confirmation:** Requires alignment between Vortex signals and CMF divergence.  

**Entry Rules (Long):**  
- VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend signal).  
- CMF shows bullish divergence (rising CMF while price is flat/declining).  
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously for confirmation.  

**Entry Rules (Short):**  
- VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend signal).  
- CMF shows bearish divergence (falling CMF while price is flat/rising).  
- Both conditions must align for confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** VI- crosses above VI+ OR CMF turns negative.  
- **Short Exit:** VI+ crosses above VI- OR CMF turns positive.  
- Partial exits allowed if one signal weakens (e.g., CMF flattens but Vortex remains strong).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss: Place below the recent swing low (long) or above swing high (short).  
- Position sizing: Risk ≤1-2% per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods (CMF unreliable).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (14-period default).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend momentum (Vortex) with volume-backed divergence (CMF).  
- Filters false breakouts by requiring dual confirmation.  
- Exits early if volume participation wanes (CMF reversal).  

**Note:** Optimize VI lookback (default 14) and CMF period for your asset’s volatility.
