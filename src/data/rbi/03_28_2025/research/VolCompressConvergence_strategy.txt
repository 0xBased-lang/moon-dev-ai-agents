STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressConvergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection**: Uses Bollinger Band width to identify periods of extremely low volatility (below 10th percentile).  
2. **Price-VWAP Convergence**: Requires VWAP to be within 1 ATR of the current price, signaling potential breakout readiness.  
3. **ATR-Based Exit**: Exits trades when price moves 2x ATR from the entry point, capturing post-contraction expansions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger: Bollinger Band width (20,2) falls below its 10th percentile (measured over 100 bars).  
- Confirmation: Current price must be within ±1 ATR (14-period) of VWAP.  
- Entry: Buy/sell at market upon simultaneous satisfaction of both conditions.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Profit Target: Close position when price reaches ±2x ATR (from entry).  
- Stop Loss: None (implied by the 2x ATR exit acting as both target/stop).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on ATR (e.g., 1% risk per trade = 2x ATR stop).  
- Avoid trading during scheduled high-impact news events.  
- Maximum 3 concurrent trades to limit volatility exposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + width calculation.  
2. VWAP (daily anchor).  
3. ATR (14-period).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility percentile thresholds with VWAP convergence for high-probability breakout entries.  
- Self-adjusting exits via ATR account for changing market conditions.  
- Avoids overfitting by using percentile-based thresholds instead of fixed values.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different percentile thresholds (5th-15th) for Bollinger width.  
- Experiment with VWAP convergence multiples (0.75-1.25 ATR).  
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals.
