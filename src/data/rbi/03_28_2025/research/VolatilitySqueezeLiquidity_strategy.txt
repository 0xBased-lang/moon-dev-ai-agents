STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeLiquidity

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction, volume analysis, and liquidity gap identification for high-probability breakout trades. Here are the key components:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Bollinger Band Contraction: Looks for periods when Bollinger Bands narrow significantly compared to historical volatility (measured by percentiles)
- Volume Surge: Requires trading volume to spike above its 50-period median
- Liquidity Gaps: Identifies price zones with recent high-frequency trade clusters that may act as targets

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below 20th percentile of its historical range (100-period lookback)
- Confirm volume spike exceeding 50-period median volume by at least 25%
- Enter long on breakout above upper Bollinger Band or short below lower Bollinger Band
- Only trade in direction of prevailing higher timeframe trend (confirmed by 200EMA)

3. EXIT RULES:
- Primary target: Nearest liquidity gap (recent high-frequency trade cluster zone)
- Secondary exit: When Bollinger Band width expands beyond 80th percentile
- Stop loss: Opposite side of the breakout Bollinger Band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs)

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- Minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio required
- Avoid trading during major economic news events
- Daily loss limit of 5% of capital

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
- Volume (50-period median)
- Historical volatility percentile (100-period lookback)
- 200-period EMA (trend filter)
- High-frequency trade cluster detection (requires tick data or order book analysis)

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Test different volatility percentile thresholds (15th-25th)
- Adjust volume surge requirement based on asset liquidity
- Validate liquidity gaps with recent price action (support/resistance)
- Consider adding momentum confirmation (RSI between 40-60 at breakout)

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, and requires careful monitoring of the volatility contraction phase before breakout opportunities emerge.
