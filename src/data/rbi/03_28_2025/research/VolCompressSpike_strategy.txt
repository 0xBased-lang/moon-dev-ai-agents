STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressSpike

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme volatility compression followed by high-volume breakouts, combining Bollinger Band analysis with volume confirmation for precise entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses Bollinger Band width to identify compression periods (6-month percentile lows)
2. Volume Confirmation: Requires 200% spike above 30-day average volume
3. Breakout Threshold: 1.5 standard deviations for exits
4. Risk Management: Stop-loss at compression range midpoint

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to reach lowest 6th percentile (extreme compression)
2. Confirm with volume spike >200% of 30-day average
3. Enter long/short in direction of initial breakout candle

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit when price moves beyond 1.5 standard deviations from mean
2. Stop-loss placed at midpoint of compression range
3. Alternative exit if volume drops below 50% of 30-day average for 3 consecutive periods

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated based on distance to stop-loss
2. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator
3. Volume (30-day average)
4. Percentile ranking calculator (6-month lookback)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different percentile thresholds (5th-10th)
2. Experiment with volume spike multiples (150-250%)
3. Adjust standard deviation exit targets (1.25-2.0)
4. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., no trades when RSI >70/<30)

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, avoiding pure mean-reversion or strong trending environments. Requires daily monitoring for compression setups.
