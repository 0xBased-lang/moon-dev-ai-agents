STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band Width reaches a 20-day low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** A breakout candle must close outside the Bollinger Bands, indicating a strong directional move.  
3. **Volume Filter:** The breakout must be accompanied by volume exceeding 1.5x the 10-day average to confirm genuine participation.  
4. **Exit Signal:** Positions are closed when a reversal occurs, measured by a 2x ATR (Average True Range) move against the position.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band Width contracts to a 20-day low.  
  2. A bullish candle closes above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds 1.5x the 10-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band Width contracts to a 20-day low.  
  2. A bearish candle closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds 1.5x the 10-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Close the position when price moves 2x ATR below the highest high since entry.  
- **Short Exit:** Close the position when price moves 2x ATR above the lowest low since entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Use the 2x ATR reversal as a dynamic stop-loss to protect profits and limit losses.  
2. **Position Sizing:** Adjust position size based on ATR to ensure consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1% risk per trade).  
3. **Avoid Overcrowded Breakouts:** If multiple assets signal simultaneously, prioritize those with the highest volume confirmation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** To measure volatility contraction and breakout levels.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width:** To identify 20-day lows in volatility.  
3. **Volume (10-day average):** To filter high-probability breakouts.  
4. **ATR (14-period):** To determine exit conditions and risk management.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts.  
- Backtest on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to confirm robustness.  

The **BandwidthBreakout** strategy combines volatility contraction, volume confirmation, and dynamic exits for high-probability breakout trading.
