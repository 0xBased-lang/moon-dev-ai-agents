STRATEGY_NAME: HullMomentumBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the precision of Hull Moving Average (HMA) slope analysis with Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) confirmation to identify high-probability breakout trades, using volume-weighted Fibonacci retracements for strategic exits.

Key Components:
1. Hull Moving Average (HMA) - Smoothed trend indicator with reduced lag
2. HMA Slope Threshold - Minimum angle requirement for trend validity
3. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) - Confirms trend strength/direction
4. Volume-Weighted Fibonacci Retracement - Exit levels adjusted by trading volume

Entry Rules:
1. HMA must show upward slope exceeding predefined angle threshold (e.g., 30 degrees)
2. CMO must be above +50 (strong uptrend) or below -50 (strong downtrend)
3. Price must break through recent swing high/low with confirmation candle close
4. Volume should be above 20-period average on breakout candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Target: 1.618 Fibonacci extension of recent swing
2. Secondary Exit: 38.2% volume-weighted retracement from breakout point
3. Emergency Exit: When HMA slope flattens below threshold angle
4. Stop Loss: Recent swing low (long) or high (short) beyond breakout point

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss must be placed immediately after entry
3. Trail stop to breakeven after reaching 1:1 risk-reward ratio
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account

Required Indicators:
1. Hull Moving Average (14-period recommended)
2. HMA Slope Angle Indicator
3. Chande Momentum Oscillator (20-period)
4. Volume Weighted Fibonacci Retracement Tool
5. Standard Volume Indicator

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust HMA period based on asset volatility (shorter for crypto, longer for stocks)
- Slope threshold may need testing between 25-45 degrees
- CMO period can be optimized between 14-30 periods
- Fibonacci levels can be weighted by 1-3 period volume average

This strategy excels in trending markets but should be avoided during choppy, range-bound conditions. The combination of HMA slope and CMO filtering helps avoid false breakouts while the volume-weighted exits maximize profit potential.
