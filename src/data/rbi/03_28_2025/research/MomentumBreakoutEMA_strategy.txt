STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBreakoutEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum breakout signals using EMA crossovers and ADX strength, coupled with a volatility-based exit mechanism.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification - Uses the golden/death cross of 50/200 EMAs
2. Momentum Confirmation - Requires ADX > 25 to confirm strong trend
3. Volatility Management - Uses 2x ATR(14) for trailing stops

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA (golden cross)
   - ADX rises above 25 (confirming strong trend)
   - Enter on next candle's open after both conditions are met

2. Short Entry:
   - 50 EMA crosses below 200 EMA (death cross)
   - ADX rises above 25 (confirming strong trend)
   - Enter on next candle's open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions:
   - Trail stop at highest high minus 2x ATR(14)
   - Exit when price hits trailing stop level

2. For short positions:
   - Trail stop at lowest low plus 2x ATR(14)
   - Exit when price hits trailing stop level

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the ATR(14) value
2. Initial stop can be set at 1x ATR(14) from entry
3. Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade
4. Consider scaling out of positions as profits accumulate

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Average Directional Index (ADX) - 14 period recommended
4. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period

Additional Notes:
- Works best on daily or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- More reliable in trending markets than ranging conditions
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Backtest different ATR multiples (1.5x-3x) for optimal stop placement
- Watch for EMA cross validity - the steeper the angle, the stronger the signal
