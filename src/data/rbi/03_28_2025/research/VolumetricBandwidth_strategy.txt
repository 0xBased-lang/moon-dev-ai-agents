STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBandwidth  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted MACD (VW-MACD):** A modified MACD that incorporates volume into its calculation, providing momentum signals with volume confirmation.  
2. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Measures the narrowing of Bollinger Bands, indicating low volatility and potential breakout conditions.  
3. **Momentum-Volatility Synergy:** Combines momentum (VW-MACD) with volatility (Bandwidth) to identify high-probability entries during low-volatility periods.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **VW-MACD Crossover:** Enter long when the VW-MACD line crosses above its signal line (typically 50-period).  
2. **Bandwidth Contraction:** Confirm entry only when Bollinger Bandwidth is below 1%, signaling extreme compression.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **VW-MACD Reversal:** Exit when the VW-MACD line crosses below its signal line.  
2. **Bandwidth Expansion:** Exit if Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond 3%, indicating increased volatility and potential trend exhaustion.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the swing high (for shorts).  
2. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Exit if the trade doesnâ€™t follow through within 3-5 bars after entry.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted MACD (50-period):** Custom MACD incorporating volume.  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Standard settings for bandwidth calculation.  
3. **Bandwidth Formula:** (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band * 100.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- **Volume-Weighted Momentum:** Filters false signals by requiring volume participation.  
- **Volatility Confirmation:** Uses bandwidth contraction to time entries during "calm before the storm" phases.  
- **Dual Exit Logic:** Combines momentum reversal and volatility expansion for robust exits.  

**Note:** This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends but may underperform in sustained high-volatility regimes. Backtest for optimal bandwidth thresholds.
