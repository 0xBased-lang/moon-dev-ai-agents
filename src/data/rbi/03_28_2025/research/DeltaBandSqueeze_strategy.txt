STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaBand Squeeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band dynamics with volume delta analysis to identify high-probability short opportunities during market contractions. The core premise exploits the relationship between volatility compression (Bollinger Band width) and increasing selling pressure (negative delta volume) to time bearish breakouts.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures volatility compression when the distance between upper/lower bands falls below historical norms
2. Negative Delta Volume: Tracks the difference between selling volume and buying volume showing increasing bearish pressure
3. Rolling Median Width: Establishes dynamic thresholds for volatility expansion exits

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Price breaks below lower Bollinger Band
2. Confirmation: Bollinger Band width must be in contraction (below its 20-period average)
3. Volume Filter: Negative delta volume must be increasing over past 3 periods
4. Timing: All conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: When Bollinger Band width expands above its 20-period rolling median
2. Stop Loss: 2x the average true range (ATR) above entry price
3. Emergency Exit: If positive delta volume spikes above 2 standard deviations of its mean

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum Drawdown: 5% stop for entire strategy
3. Time Exit: Close position if no exit triggers within 5 bars
4. Market Filter: Only trade when VIX > 15 (avoid low volatility regimes)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Band Width (20-period SMA of width)
3. Volume Delta (1-minute or tick data preferred)
4. Average True Range (14)
5. VIX Index (for market filter)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different Bollinger periods (14-26) and deviations (1.8-2.2)
- Adjust delta volume lookback period (3-5 bars)
- Experiment with rolling median period (15-25) for exit threshold

This strategy works best in trending markets transitioning from low to high volatility, particularly effective during bearish reversals after prolonged consolidations. The DeltaBand Squeeze approach provides a systematic way to capture breakdown moves with confirmed selling pressure.
