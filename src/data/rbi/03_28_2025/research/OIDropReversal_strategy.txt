STRATEGY_NAME: OIDropReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines open interest dynamics with technical indicators to identify potential reversal opportunities in oversold conditions.

Key Components:
1. Open Interest Analysis: Tracks 24-hour open interest changes as a sentiment indicator
2. Price Action: Requires significant price decline to confirm oversold conditions
3. RSI Filter: Uses RSI to validate oversold conditions
4. SMA Exit: Implements a simple moving average crossover for trend confirmation

Entry Rules:
- Trigger Condition 1: 24-hour open interest drops by 20% (significant decrease in market participation)
- Trigger Condition 2: Price declines by 5% (confirms downward momentum)
- Confirmation: RSI < 30 (validates oversold conditions)
- All three conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: When price crosses above 10-period SMA (trend reversal confirmation)
- Secondary Exit: RSI > 50 (momentum normalization)
- Whichever condition occurs first triggers the exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Recommended 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop Loss: Consider placing below recent swing low (not specified in original rules)
3. Time Filter: Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
4. Asset Selection: Best suited for liquid futures or perpetual swap markets

Required Indicators:
1. Open Interest (24-hour change calculation)
2. Price Percentage Change Calculator
3. Relative Strength Index (14-period standard)
4. 10-period Simple Moving Average

Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets experiencing sharp corrections
- Requires reliable open interest data source
- May generate fewer signals in stable markets
- Complementary volume analysis could enhance signal reliability

Optimization Considerations:
- Adjust RSI thresholds based on asset volatility
- Test different SMA periods for exit optimization
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
