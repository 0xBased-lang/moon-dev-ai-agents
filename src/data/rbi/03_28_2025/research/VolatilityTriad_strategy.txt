STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityTriad  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Triple Confirmation Setup:**  
   - **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Measures volatility compression (narrowing bands).  
   - **Keltner Channel Squeeze:** Confirms low volatility when price is constrained within the Keltner bands.  
   - **Declining Volume:** Validates weakening participation during the contraction phase.  

2. **Entry Trigger:**  
   - Breakout above/below the Bollinger Band or Keltner Channel (direction depends on trend context or higher timeframe bias).  
   - Volume should expand on the breakout to confirm new momentum.  

3. **Exit Conditions:**  
   - **Opposite Volatility Expansion:** Exit when Bollinger Bands widen significantly or price reverses beyond the opposite Keltner Channel boundary.  
   - **Trailing Stop:** Use a percentage or ATR-based trailing stop to lock in profits during sustained moves.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-adjusted).  
- Stop-loss placed beyond the recent swing high/low or outside the contraction range.  
- Risk per trade limited to 1-2% of capital.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev).  
2. Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5x ATR multiplier).  
3. Volume indicator (OBV or simple volume MA).  
4. Optional: ATR for trailing stop calibration.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines three volatility filters to reduce false breakouts, targeting high-probability expansions after consolidation.
