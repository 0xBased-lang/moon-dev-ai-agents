STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Filter:** Uses Bollinger Band Width (BBW) percentile below 10% to identify periods of extremely low volatility, signaling potential breakout setups.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** Requires a significant surge in trading volume (e.g., 1.5-2x the average volume) to validate the breakout.  
3. **Breakout Entry:** Enters long/short when price breaks above/below the Bollinger Band after meeting the volatility and volume criteria.  
4. **Opposite Band Exit:** Exits the trade when price touches the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., exit long when touching the lower band).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. BBW percentile < 10% (indicating extreme contraction).  
  2. Volume surges above a predefined threshold (e.g., 1.5x 20-period average volume).  
  3. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. BBW percentile < 10%.  
  2. Volume surge occurs.  
  3. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Price touches the lower Bollinger Band.  
- **Short Exit:** Price touches the upper Bollinger Band.  
- Optional: Trailing stop or time-based exit (e.g., close after 5 bars if target not hit).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stop distance).  
- Stop-loss placed at the midpoint of the Bollinger Bands or recent swing low/high.  
- Risk per trade limited to 1-2% of capital.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev).  
2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) and its percentile (e.g., 20-period lookback).  
3. Volume (with moving average for surge detection).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines low volatility (BBW percentile) with volume confirmation for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses opposite band touch for dynamic exit, capturing trends while avoiding reversals.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring volume surge.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different BBW percentile thresholds (5%-15%).  
- Adjust volume surge multiplier based on asset liquidity.  
- Experiment with exit variants (e.g., partial profit at mid-band).  

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, with volume acting as a catalyst. The name "VolSurgeBreakout" reflects its dual focus on volatility contraction and volume-powered breakouts.
