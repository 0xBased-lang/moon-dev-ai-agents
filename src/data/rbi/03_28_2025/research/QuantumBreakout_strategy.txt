STRATEGY_NAME: QuantumBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Order Book Imbalance (OBI) Filter:** The strategy uses a statistical measure of order book imbalance, triggering trades only when the current imbalance exceeds two standard deviations of its 20-period average. This ensures trades are taken during periods of significant liquidity shifts.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** A secondary filter requires the Bollinger Band width to contract below 0.5%, indicating low volatility and potential for an explosive breakout.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** Trades are executed only when both conditions align—high order book imbalance and tight Bollinger Band width—signaling a high-probability breakout scenario.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Order book imbalance > 2 standard deviations above its 20-period average.  
  2. Bollinger Band width < 0.5%.  
  3. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Order book imbalance < 2 standard deviations below its 20-period average.  
  2. Bollinger Band width < 0.5%.  
  3. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Close the trade when price reaches a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) or when Bollinger Band width expands beyond a threshold (e.g., 2%).  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Exit if price retraces into the Bollinger Band or if the order book imbalance reverts to its mean (20-period average).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
2. Stop loss placed at the opposite Bollinger Band or a recent swing low/high.  
3. Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Order book imbalance (calculated as bid-ask volume difference).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations, width = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  
3. Standard deviation of order book imbalance (20-period rolling window).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines liquidity dynamics (order book) with volatility contraction (Bollinger Bands) for high-probability breakouts.  
- Statistical thresholds (2 standard deviations) reduce false signals.  
- Suitable for both crypto and traditional markets with liquid order books.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Adjust the Bollinger Band width threshold (0.3%-0.7%) based on asset volatility.  
- Test different lookback periods for order book imbalance (e.g., 10-30 periods).  
- Add a time filter (e.g., only trade during high-volume hours).
