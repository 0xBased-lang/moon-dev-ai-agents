STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeSilhouetteEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation with volume analysis and momentum exhaustion signals to capture high-probability moves during low-volume consolidation periods.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification: Uses the 50/200 EMA crossover as primary trend confirmation
2. Volume Filter: Requires declining volume during the setup period
3. Momentum Exit: Uses RSI overbought condition as profit-taking signal
4. Risk Management: Implements strict 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for 50-period EMA to cross above 200-period EMA (golden cross)
2. Confirm volume is in a declining trend (at least 3 consecutive lower volume bars)
3. Enter long on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Set at 2x initial risk (e.g., if stop is 50 pips, target is +100 pips)
2. Protective Stop: Place below most recent swing low or 1% of account equity
3. Early Exit: Close position if RSI(14) exceeds 70

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Volume indicator (preferably with 5-period MA for trend analysis)
4. 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Risk Management:
1. Position size should not exceed 1-2% of account per trade
2. Maintain 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio on all trades
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause volume spikes
4. Consider time-based exits if trade doesn't develop within 3-5 periods

Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets, may produce false signals in choppy conditions
- Volume decline should be noticeable but not extreme (avoid ultra-low volume)
- Combine with price action confirmation for higher probability entries
- Most effective on daily or 4-hour timeframes for swing trading
