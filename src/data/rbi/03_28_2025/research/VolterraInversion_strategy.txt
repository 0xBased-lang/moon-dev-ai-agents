STRATEGY_NAME: Volterra Inversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The Volterra Inversion strategy capitalizes on volatility regime shifts by combining VIX futures term structure analysis with realized volatility metrics and Bollinger Bandwidth contraction signals.

Key Components:
1. VIX Futures Term Structure: Monitors for inversion (backwardation) in VIX futures contracts
2. Realized Volatility: Tracks 5-day vs 20-day realized volatility relationship
3. Bollinger Bandwidth: Measures market contraction using bandwidth percentiles

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VIX futures term structure must be inverted (front month > back month)
2. Confirmation: 5-day realized volatility crosses below its 20-day average
3. Timing: Enter long volatility positions (or short equity positions) when both conditions align

Exit Rules:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2) contracts below its 25th percentile level
2. Alternative Exit: VIX term structure returns to contango (front month < back month)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility-adjusted risk units
2. Hard stop-loss at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the underlying
3. Maximum portfolio allocation of 5% to any single volatility trade

Required Indicators:
1. VIX futures term structure (front month vs next month)
2. 5-day and 20-day realized volatility calculations
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with bandwidth calculation
4. Historical bandwidth percentile rankings
5. Average True Range (ATR) for stop placement

Special Considerations:
- Most effective during market regime transitions
- Requires monitoring of both spot VIX and futures
- Works best on daily or higher timeframes
- Complementary to equity portfolio hedging strategies

Optimization Notes:
- Backtest different bandwidth percentile thresholds (20th-30th)
- Experiment with various realized volatility lookback periods
- Consider adding volume confirmation for entries
