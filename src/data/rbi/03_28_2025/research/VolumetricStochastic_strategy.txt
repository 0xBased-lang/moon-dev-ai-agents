STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricStochastic

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricStochastic strategy combines momentum and volume analysis to identify high-probability reversal opportunities. This approach synchronizes stochastic oscillator signals with OBV divergence patterns, filtered through volatility-adjusted position sizing.

Key Components:
1. Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3 settings) - Identifies overbought (>80) and oversold (<20) conditions
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) - Detects bullish/bearish divergence against price
3. ATR (14-period) - Calculates volatility-adjusted profit targets

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- Stochastic crosses above 20 from oversold territory
- Price making lower low while OBV makes higher low (bullish divergence)
- Confirm with price closing above recent swing low

SHORT ENTRY:
- Stochastic crosses below 80 from overbought territory
- Price making higher high while OBV makes lower high (bearish divergence)
- Confirm with price closing below recent swing high

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: 1.5x current ATR from entry price
- Stop Loss: 0.75x current ATR from entry price
- Emergency Exit: Stochastic reverses direction (crosses back through 20/80 level)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade (stop loss distance)
2. Maximum 3 concurrent open positions
3. No trading during major economic news events
4. Daily time filter - only trade first 6 hours of session

Required Indicators:
1. Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)
2. On-Balance Volume
3. Average True Range (14)
4. Price chart with swing points marked

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ATR multiples (1.25x-2x) for profit targets
- Experiment with stochastic settings (13-15 periods)
- Consider adding 50-period EMA as trend filter for stronger signals

This strategy works best in ranging markets and requires patience to wait for the confluence of both momentum and volume signals before entering trades.
