STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Bollinger Band Squeeze (20-period, 2 STD) identifies low volatility periods before potential breakouts
- Volume-Weighted MACD confirms momentum shift with volume confirmation
- ATR-based stops provide dynamic risk management
- Fixed 1:3 risk-reward ratio ensures positive expectancy

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract (squeeze) to below 50% of their 20-period average width
- Enter long when:
  a) Price closes outside the upper Bollinger Band (breakout)
  b) Volume-Weighted MACD crosses above zero line simultaneously
- Enter short when:
  a) Price closes outside the lower Bollinger Band (breakdown)
  b) Volume-Weighted MACD crosses below zero line simultaneously

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit Target: 3x ATR(14) from entry price in direction of trade
- Stop Loss: 1x ATR(14) from entry price against trade direction
- Secondary Exit: Close trade if Volume-Weighted MACD crosses back below zero (for longs) or above zero (for shorts)

4. Risk Management:
- Position size calculated based on 1% risk per trade using ATR stop distance
- No new entries if account drawdown exceeds 5% from peak
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions open

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Volume-Weighted MACD (standard parameters with volume input)
- ATR (14-period)
- Bollinger Band Width indicator (for squeeze detection)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets, avoid ranging conditions
- Volume confirmation is critical to filter false breakouts
- Backtest suggests optimal performance in commodities and indices
