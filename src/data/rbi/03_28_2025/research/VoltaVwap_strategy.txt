STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaVwap  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
The VoltaVwap strategy combines volatility-adjusted VWAP crossovers with Bollinger Band contraction to identify high-probability entries, while using dynamic profit targets and opposing signals for exits.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Adjusted VWAP**: Uses a modified VWAP that adjusts for recent volatility conditions  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Filter**: Requires contraction below 10-day low to confirm low-volatility setup  
3. **Dynamic Profit Targets**: Uses 2x average daily range for take-profit levels  
4. **Opposing Signal Exit**: Triggers exit when price crosses VWAP in opposite direction  

**Entry Rules (Long):**  
1. Price crosses ABOVE volatility-adjusted VWAP  
2. Bollinger Band width is at 10-day low (contraction)  
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously  

**Entry Rules (Short):**  
1. Price crosses BELOW volatility-adjusted VWAP  
2. Bollinger Band width is at 10-day low (contraction)  
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target**: Close position when price reaches 2x average daily range from entry  
2. **Stop Loss**: Opposite VWAP crossover (long exits when crosses below, short exits when crosses above)  
3. **Time Exit**: Close all positions at end of trading session if not triggered  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade  
2. No pyramiding allowed - single position only  
3. Stop loss automatically moves to breakeven when price reaches 1x ADR  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Volatility-adjusted VWAP (20-period lookback with volatility multiplier)  
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation  
3. 10-day Bollinger Band width minimum filter  
4. Average Daily Range (14-day calculation)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines VWAP reliability with volatility contraction setups  
- Uses adaptive profit targets based on market conditions  
- Requires confirmation from both price action and volatility indicators  
- Particularly effective in ranging markets transitioning to trends  

**Implementation Notes:**  
1. Calculate volatility-adjusted VWAP by multiplying standard deviation by recent ATR  
2. Bollinger Band width = (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band  
3. Verify 10-day width low using rolling minimum calculation  
4. ADR should be calculated excluding overnight gaps
