STRATEGY_NAME: VortexBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Used to confirm the trend direction. The strategy enters trades when the VI+ (positive trend) line is above the VI- (negative trend) line, indicating a bullish trend, or vice versa for bearish trends.  
2. **Choppiness Index (CI):** Measures market consolidation. A CI value below a set threshold (e.g., 38.2) suggests the market is trending, making it favorable for breakout trades.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Rising volume during the breakout strengthens the signal, indicating increased participation and momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ > VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  - CI < threshold (e.g., 38.2, indicating trending conditions).  
  - Volume is rising compared to recent average (e.g., 20-period SMA of volume).  
  - Price breaks above a recent high or key resistance level.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- > VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  - CI < threshold (e.g., 38.2).  
  - Volume is rising compared to recent average.  
  - Price breaks below a recent low or key support level.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** VI+ crosses below VI-, signaling a potential trend reversal.  
- **Short Exit:** VI- crosses below VI+, signaling a potential trend reversal.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low (for long) or above the recent swing high (for short). Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or ATR-based stop.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on account risk (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
- Trailing stops can be used to lock in profits as the trend progresses.  
- Avoid trading during high CI periods (choppy markets) to reduce false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) – Default period (14).  
2. Choppiness Index (CI) – Default period (14).  
3. Volume (with moving average for comparison).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform in ranging conditions.  
- Backtest optimal CI thresholds for different assets/timeframes.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., candlestick patterns) for higher-probability entries.
