STRATEGY_NAME: ForceBand Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Elder Force Index momentum signals with Bollinger Band contraction/expansion patterns for high-probability breakout trading.

Key Components:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period) - measures buying/selling pressure
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - identifies contraction/expansion phases
3. ATR (14-period) - sets dynamic exit thresholds
4. Price action - confirms breakout direction

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below 50% of its 20-period average (narrowing volatility)
2. Elder Force Index must cross above zero for long entries or below zero for short entries
3. Price must break above upper band (long) or below lower band (short)
4. All three conditions must align within 3 bars of each other

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit: When Bollinger Band width expands beyond 1.5x the current ATR value
2. Secondary exit: When Elder Force Index crosses back below zero (long) or above zero (short)
3. Emergency exit: 2x ATR trailing stop from entry point

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Initial stop placed at 1x ATR from entry
3. No trading during major economic news events
4. Maximum 5 concurrent positions open

Required Indicators:
1. Elder Force Index (13-period)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
3. ATR (14-period)
4. Bollinger Band Width indicator

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different ATR multipliers (1.3x-1.7x) for exit threshold
2. Experiment with 10-15 period Force Index
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This "ForceBand Breakout" strategy capitalizes on the convergence of momentum (Force Index) and volatility contraction/expansion (Bollinger Bands), using ATR for dynamic risk management. The unique combination provides high-quality breakout signals while minimizing false breakouts.
