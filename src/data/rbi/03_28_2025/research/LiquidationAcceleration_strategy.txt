STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationAcceleration  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Order Book Imbalance Analysis**: Detects clustered liquidation levels by analyzing order book depth and liquidity zones.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation**: Enters trades when price accelerates beyond identified liquidation zones, signaling strong momentum.  
3. **Dynamic Exit Mechanism**: Uses Chandelier stops to trail exits based on volatility, locking in profits while allowing room for price expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Liquidation Zone Identification**: Use order book data to pinpoint levels where stop-loss clusters are likely to trigger liquidations (e.g., high-density stop orders).  
2. **Breakout Trigger**: Enter long/short when price:  
   - Breaks above/below the liquidation zone with strong volume.  
   - Shows acceleration (e.g., sharp candlestick close beyond the zone).  
3. **Confirmation Filter**: Optional: Require a minimum order book imbalance (e.g., 2:1 bid/ask ratio) to validate the breakout.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Chandelier Stop**:  
   - For longs: Set stop below the highest high since entry, minus a multiple of ATR (e.g., 3x ATR).  
   - For shorts: Set stop above the lowest low since entry, plus a multiple of ATR.  
2. **Time-Based Exit**: Close trades after a fixed period (e.g., 24 hours) if the stop isn’t hit.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk ≤1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss**: Initial stop placed just beyond the opposite side of the liquidation zone (invalidates the breakout if hit).  
3. **Volatility Adjustment**: Reduce position size during high ATR regimes.  

**Required Indicators/Tools:**  
1. **Order Book Depth Data** (e.g., bid/ask liquidity heatmap).  
2. **ATR (14-period)** for Chandelier stop calculation.  
3. **Volume Indicator** to confirm breakout strength.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines liquidation hunting (common in crypto markets) with momentum breakout and adaptive exits, targeting explosive moves post-liquidation cascades.
