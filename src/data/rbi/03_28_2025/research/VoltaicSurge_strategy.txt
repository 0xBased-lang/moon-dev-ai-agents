STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Filter:** Uses the 14-day ATR (Average True Range) being below its 50-day average to identify periods of low volatility, signaling potential breakout setups.  
2. **Breakout Trigger:** Enters long when price breaks above the 20-day high, confirming momentum.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires volume to exceed 1.5x the 50-day average volume, ensuring strong participation in the breakout.  
4. **Trailing Stop Exit:** Uses a dynamic 3x ATR trailing stop to lock in profits while allowing room for volatility expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** 14-day ATR < 50-day ATR average (volatility contraction).  
- **Condition 2:** Price breaks above the 20-day high (breakout confirmation).  
- **Condition 3:** Current volume > 1.5x 50-day average volume (participation validation).  
- **Action:** Enter long at the breakout level or next candle open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Set a stop-loss at 3x the current 14-day ATR below the highest high since entry. Adjust dynamically as price moves higher.  
- **Optional Time Exit:** Consider exiting after a fixed period (e.g., 10 days) if no stop is hit, to avoid stagnation.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to limit downside.  
- **Stop-Loss Initialization:** The 3x ATR trailing stop ensures risk is proportional to recent volatility.  
- **Avoid Overcrowding:** Do not enter if multiple correlated assets are signaling breakouts simultaneously (diversify entries).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ATR (14-period & 50-period average)** – For volatility contraction detection.  
2. **20-day High** – Breakout level reference.  
3. **Volume (50-day average & current)** – To confirm breakout strength.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction, high-volume breakouts, and adaptive trailing stops to capture explosive moves while minimizing false signals. The 3x ATR stop allows for wider swings in high-momentum trades.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different ATR multiples (e.g., 2.5x–3.5x) for the trailing stop.  
- Adjust volume thresholds (e.g., 1.3x–2x) based on asset liquidity.  
- Filter for assets with historically strong breakout tendencies (e.g., equities during earnings season).
