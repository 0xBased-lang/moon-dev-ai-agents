STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on trading breakouts from clustered liquidation levels identified through on-chain leverage data, combining volume confirmation with dynamic order flow analysis for exits.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Level Identification: Uses on-chain data to detect price levels with high concentrations of liquidations (both long and short)
2. Volume Confirmation: Requires significant volume surge on breakout confirmation candles
3. Order Flow Analysis: Monitors subsequent order flow imbalances to establish dynamic support/resistance levels

Entry Rules:
1. Identify clustered liquidation zones through on-chain leverage data (typically where many stops are concentrated)
2. Wait for price to approach these levels with increasing volume
3. Enter on close of confirmation candle that:
   - Breaks through liquidation level
   - Shows volume significantly above recent average (suggesting liquidation cascade)
   - Preferably closes near high/low of candle for direction confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Initial exit at 1.5-2x average true range (ATR) from entry
2. Secondary exit based on order flow imbalances:
   - Watch for large opposing volume spikes
   - Monitor delta divergence (volume vs price movement)
   - Exit when order flow shows strong counter-trend pressure
3. Emergency exit if price retraces back through original liquidation level

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance to opposite liquidation level
2. Stop loss placed just beyond opposite side of liquidation zone
3. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
4. Reduce position size during high volatility periods

Required Indicators:
1. On-chain liquidation level data (from platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant)
2. Volume indicator (preferably with MA comparison)
3. Order flow tools (volume delta, footprint charts)
4. Average True Range (ATR) for volatility measurement
5. Price action confirmation (candle patterns at key levels)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in high leverage crypto markets
- Most effective when multiple liquidation levels cluster near same price
- Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
- Combine with overall market structure analysis for better context
