STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaClusterReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cluster Identification:**  
   - Focuses on order book delta imbalances to spot potential liquidation zones where price reversals are likely.  
   - Uses order book data to detect clusters of liquidations (long/short squeezes).  

2. **Confirmation via RSI Divergence:**  
   - Requires RSI divergence (price makes higher highs/lower lows while RSI does the opposite) to confirm reversal signals.  
   - Typically looks for bullish divergence in downtrends or bearish divergence in uptrends.  

3. **Volume Acceleration Filter:**  
   - Volume must show decreasing acceleration (slowing momentum) to validate weakening trend strength.  
   - Avoids entries during high-volume breakouts or strong trending moves.  

4. **Volatility-Based Exit:**  
   - Exits trades when volatility contracts below a rolling average (e.g., ATR or Bollinger Band width).  
   - Ensures profits are captured before consolidation or trend resumption.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Order book delta shows a liquidation cluster (excessive short liquidations).  
  2. Bullish RSI divergence forms (price lower lows, RSI higher lows).  
  3. Volume acceleration declines (confirming weakening selling pressure).  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Order book delta shows a liquidation cluster (excessive long liquidations).  
  2. Bearish RSI divergence forms (price higher highs, RSI lower highs).  
  3. Volume acceleration declines (confirming weakening buying pressure).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking:**  
  - Close position when volatility (e.g., ATR) falls below its 5-period moving average.  
  - Alternatively, use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).  

- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Place stop-loss beyond the recent swing high/low (for shorts/longs).  
  - Adjust based on order book liquidity levels to avoid slippage.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events to prevent false signals.  
- Filter trades to higher timeframes (e.g., 1H/4H) for stronger signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Order Book Delta Imbalance:** To identify liquidation clusters.  
2. **RSI (14-period):** For divergence confirmation.  
3. **Volume Acceleration Metric:** Custom script to measure rate of volume change.  
4. **Volatility Gauge (ATR or Bollinger Width):** For exit signals.  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines order book dynamics (liquidation clusters) with classical technicals (RSI divergence) for high-probability reversals.  
- Exits based on volatility contraction lock in gains before mean reversion ends.  

**Note:**  
- Works best in ranging or overextended markets; avoid strong trending conditions.  
- Requires real-time order book data and reliable volume metrics.
