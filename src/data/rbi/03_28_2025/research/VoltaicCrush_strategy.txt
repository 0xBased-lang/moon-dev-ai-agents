STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicCrush  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Focus:** This strategy capitalizes on extreme volatility spikes in the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and subsequent mean reversion signals from the VVIX (VIX of VIX).  
2. **Z-Score Filter:** Uses the 1-year Z-score of the VIX to identify statistically significant spikes, ensuring only high-probability setups are traded.  
3. **VVIX Confirmation:** Requires the VVIX to break below its 20-day SMA, signaling a loss of momentum in volatility-of-volatility and potential reversal.  
4. **Bollinger Band Exit:** Exits the trade when VIX closes below the midpoint of its 10-day Bollinger Bands, indicating a return to normal volatility levels.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short SPX** when:  
  1. VIX spikes above its 1-year Z-score threshold (e.g., Z > 2 for extreme moves).  
  2. VVIX simultaneously breaks below its 20-day SMA.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close the short position when:  
  1. VIX closes below the midpoint of its 10-day Bollinger Bands (middle band).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to limit downside.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Optional stop-loss can be placed above recent highs in SPX or if VVIX reverses back above its 20-day SMA.  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Consider exiting after a set period (e.g., 5-10 days) if the exit condition isnâ€™t met.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VIX 1-Year Z-Score:** To quantify extreme volatility spikes.  
2. **VVIX 20-Day SMA:** For confirmation of weakening volatility momentum.  
3. **VIX 10-Day Bollinger Bands:** To identify mean reversion exit points.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility (VIX) and volatility-of-volatility (VVIX) for high-conviction reversals.  
- Uses statistical (Z-score) and trend-following (SMA) filters to avoid false signals.  
- Bollinger Band midpoint provides a dynamic, adaptive exit threshold.  

**Note:** This strategy is best deployed during periods of elevated market stress (e.g., post-earnings, macro events) when VIX spikes are more likely to revert. Backtest for optimal Z-score threshold and SMA period adjustments.
