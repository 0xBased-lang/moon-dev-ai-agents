STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Strength Confirmation**: Uses ADX (Average Directional Index) > 30 to ensure strong trending conditions.  
2. **Volume-Price Divergence**: Relies on On-Balance Volume (OBV) diverging from price action to signal potential reversals or continuations.  
3. **Volatility-Based Exits**: Employs Keltner Channel bands to exit trades when price crosses the bands, particularly during high volatility regimes.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  - ADX > 30 (confirming strong trend).  
  - Price making lower lows while OBV makes higher lows (bullish divergence).  
  - Enter on the next candle closing above the prior high (confirmation).  
- **Short Entry**:  
  - ADX > 30 (confirming strong trend).  
  - Price making higher highs while OBV makes lower highs (bearish divergence).  
  - Enter on the next candle closing below the prior low (confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: Price closes above the upper Keltner Channel band (volatility expansion suggests potential exhaustion).  
- **Short Exit**: Price closes below the lower Keltner Channel band (volatility expansion suggests potential exhaustion).  
- **Optional Stop-Loss**:  
  - For longs: Recent swing low or below the lower Keltner Channel band.  
  - For shorts: Recent swing high or above the upper Keltner Channel band.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
- Stop-loss placement as described above to limit downside.  
- Avoid trading during low ADX (<25) to sidestep choppy markets.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ADX (14-period default)** – To gauge trend strength.  
2. **OBV (On-Balance Volume)** – To detect divergence against price.  
3. **Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2x ATR multiplier)** – For volatility-based exits.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend strength (ADX), volume confirmation (OBV divergence), and volatility (Keltner) for high-probability setups.  
- Focuses on "smart exits" during high volatility to capture momentum before reversals.  
- Avoids false signals by requiring multiple confirmations (trend + divergence + breakout).  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different ADX thresholds (e.g., 25-35) for varying asset volatility.  
- Adjust Keltner Channel ATR multiplier (1.5-2.5) based on market conditions.  
- Filter trades with a higher timeframe trend alignment for added confidence.
