STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted price action with volatility contraction/expansion signals for high-probability entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted Moving Average (50-period VWMA) - Filters trades based on price relative to volume-weighted trend
2. Keltner Channel (14-period) - Measures volatility conditions through channel width
3. Percentile Bands (20th/80th) - Identifies extreme volatility conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Price must cross ABOVE the 50-period VWMA (confirms bullish momentum with volume confirmation)
2. Simultaneously, the Keltner Channel width must be in contraction (below 20th percentile width)
3. Both conditions must occur on the same candle for valid entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When Keltner Channel width expands above 80th percentile (volatility expansion signal)
2. Optional Stop Loss: Recent swing low below VWMA or fixed percentage risk

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (ATR-based or fixed percentage)
2. Stop loss placement below recent swing low or VWMA
3. No new entries when channel width > 50th percentile

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted Moving Average (50 period)
2. Keltner Channels (14 period with 1.5 ATR multiplier recommended)
3. Channel Width Percentile Calculator (requires lookback period for percentile calculation)

Unique Aspects:
- Combines volume confirmation with volatility regime detection
- Uses dynamic percentile-based thresholds rather than fixed values
- Requires simultaneous confirmation from both indicators
- Exits based on volatility expansion rather than price targets

Optimization Notes:
- Test different VWMA periods (40-60 range)
- Adjust Keltner Channel period and multiplier
- Verify percentile thresholds with historical volatility analysis
- Consider adding volume confirmation on breakout candles
