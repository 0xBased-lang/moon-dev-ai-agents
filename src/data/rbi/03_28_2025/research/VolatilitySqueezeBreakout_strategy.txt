STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Squeeze Detection:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when Bollinger Bands contract below a 20-day historical volatility threshold, signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Entries are triggered when price breaks out of the Bollinger Bands, indicating the start of a new trend.  
3. **Trailing Stop Exit:** Positions are managed using a trailing stop based on the Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits and minimize losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when price closes above the upper Bollinger Band after a volatility squeeze (Bollinger Band width below the 20-day historical volatility threshold).  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when price closes below the lower Bollinger Band after a volatility squeeze.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop Exit:** The stop-loss is set at a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) from the highest high (for long positions) or lowest low (for short positions) since entry.  
- **Time-Based Exit (Optional):** Exit the trade if no significant movement occurs within a predefined period (e.g., 5-10 bars).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to manage risk.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop-loss can be set at a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR) from the entry price if not using a trailing stop immediately.  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading during excessively high volatility (e.g., when ATR is above a certain threshold).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – To identify volatility squeeze and breakout levels.  
2. **Historical Volatility (20-day)** – To measure volatility contraction.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)** – For trailing stop placement and risk assessment.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- May generate false signals in choppy or range-bound conditions—consider adding a trend filter (e.g., 50/200 MA crossover) to improve accuracy.  
- Optimize ATR multiplier and Bollinger Band settings based on asset volatility.  

This strategy capitalizes on breakout momentum following low-volatility periods while using ATR to dynamically manage risk.
