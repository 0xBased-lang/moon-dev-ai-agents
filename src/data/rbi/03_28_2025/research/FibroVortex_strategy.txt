STRATEGY_NAME: FibroVortex  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Clusters:** Identify key retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) where price consolidates, indicating potential reversal zones.  
2. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Uses VI+ (positive trend) and VI- (negative trend) to confirm trend direction and volatility. Declining VI volatility suggests consolidation.  
3. **Price Consolidation:** Entry is triggered when price hovers near a Fibonacci level with reduced VI volatility, signaling a potential breakout.  
4. **Breakout Confirmation:** Exit occurs when price breaks beyond Fibonacci extremes (0% or 100%), confirming trend continuation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Price consolidates near a Fibonacci support level (e.g., 61.8%).  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  - VI volatility declines (narrowing spread between VI+ and VI-).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Price consolidates near a Fibonacci resistance level (e.g., 38.2%).  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  - VI volatility declines.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Close position when price breaches the 0% (for shorts) or 100% (for longs) Fibonacci extension level.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place stop beyond the opposite Fibonacci extreme (e.g., below 78.6% for longs, above 23.6% for shorts).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk per trade: 1-2% of capital.  
- Adjust stop levels based on volatility (e.g., ATR multiple).  
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool** (38.2%, 50%, 61.8% levels).  
2. **Vortex Indicator (VI)** (14-period default).  
3. **Optional:** ATR (14-period) for dynamic stop placement.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines Fibonacci’s precision with VI’s trend-filtering capability, targeting low-volatility consolidation breakouts for high-probability trades.
