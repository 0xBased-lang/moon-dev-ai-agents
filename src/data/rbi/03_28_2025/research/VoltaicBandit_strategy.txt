STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on volatility compression breakouts using dynamic VWAP bands
- Band width adjusted by ATR (Average True Range) for adaptive volatility scaling
- High-volume confirmation for breakout validity
- RSI divergence as exit signal for momentum exhaustion

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for VWAP band width to compress below threshold (suggested: 1.5x ATR)
- Enter long when price closes ABOVE upper VWAP band with volume > 20% above 20-period average
- Enter short when price closes BELOW lower VWAP band with volume > 20% above 20-period average
- Only trade in direction of broader trend (use 50EMA as trend filter)

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary exit: Bearish RSI divergence (price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high) for long positions
- Primary exit: Bullish RSI divergence (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low) for short positions
- Secondary exit: Price crosses back inside VWAP bands
- Emergency exit: 2x ATR stop-loss from entry point

4. Risk Management:
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- Stop-loss set at 2x ATR from entry point
- Take-profit ratio of at least 1:2 (risk:reward)
- Avoid trading during major economic news events
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions open

5. Required Indicators:
- VWAP with dynamic bands (set to Â±2 standard deviations as starting point)
- ATR (14-period recommended)
- Volume indicator with 20-period moving average
- RSI (14-period standard setting)
- 50EMA for trend filter

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on 15min-4hr timeframes
- Most effective in trending markets after consolidation periods
- Requires manual confirmation of volume spikes and RSI divergence patterns
- Backtest suggested for optimal ATR multiplier and VWAP band settings per instrument
