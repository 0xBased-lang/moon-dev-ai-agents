STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted price confirmation with strong momentum signals for high-probability entries, using adaptive trend-following for exits.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) - 5-day vs 50-day crossover
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-day) - Momentum confirmation
3. Fractal Adaptive Moving Average (10-day) - Dynamic exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 5-day VWAP must cross ABOVE 50-day VWAP (volume-confirmed trend shift)
2. Momentum Filter: 14-day Chande Oscillator must be > +50 (strong bullish momentum)
3. Both conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Close position when price closes below 10-day FRAMA for 2 consecutive days
2. Optional Stop-Loss: Consider 2% below entry price or below recent swing low

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss placement: Either:
   - Fixed percentage (1.5-2% below entry)
   - Below recent swing low
   - Below 50-day VWAP (whichever is higher)
3. Take-profit: Consider 2:1 or 3:1 risk-reward ratio based on volatility

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) - 5-day and 50-day periods
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator - 14-day period
3. Fractal Adaptive Moving Average (FRAMA) - 10-day period with default parameters

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for trending markets, may underperform in ranging conditions
- Works well on daily timeframe for swing trading
- Volume confirmation adds reliability to momentum signals
- FRAMA exit adapts to market volatility for dynamic trend-following
- Consider filtering with overall market trend for higher accuracy

Optimization Suggestions:
1. Test different VWAP periods (e.g., 3-day vs 50-day)
2. Experiment with Chande threshold levels (+40 to +60)
3. Adjust FRAMA period or confirmation days (1-3 days)
4. Add additional filters like ADX > 25 for stronger trends
