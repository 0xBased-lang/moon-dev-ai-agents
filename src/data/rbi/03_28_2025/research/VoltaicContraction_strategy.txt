STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by potential expansion, using a combination of Bollinger Bandwidth and ADX for confirmation. The approach is designed to catch early movements when volatility compresses to extreme levels and is poised for expansion.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth (20-period, 2 standard deviations) - Measures volatility contraction
2. ADX (14-period) - Identifies trend strength
3. RSI (14-period) - Provides overbought/oversold signals

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 10-day low (indicating extreme contraction)
2. Confirmation: ADX drops below 20 (signaling weak trend/consolidation)
3. Optional Filter: Price should be between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: When Bollinger Bandwidth expands to 2x its entry value
2. Protective Exit: RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition)
3. Emergency Stop: 1.5x ATR (14-period) below entry for long positions

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placed at 1.5x ATR from entry
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20-period, 2 standard deviations
- ADX: 14-period (with +DI/-DI disabled)
- RSI: 14-period
- ATR: 14-period (for stop loss calculation)

Optimization Notes:
1. The 10-day lookback period for bandwidth lows can be adjusted based on asset volatility
2. ADX threshold could be tested between 15-25
3. RSI exit level might be optimized between 65-75 depending on market conditions

This strategy works best in ranging markets and requires patience during contraction periods. It's particularly effective on daily charts for swing trading opportunities, with potential adaptation to 4-hour charts for more active traders.
