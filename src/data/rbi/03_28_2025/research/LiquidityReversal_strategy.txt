STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidity Zone Identification:** Uses the high/low of the previous 5 trading sessions to define key liquidity zones.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires declining volume during the breach of the liquidity zone to validate the reversal signal.  
3. **ATR-Based Stop:** Uses 2x the Average True Range (ATR) for dynamic stop-loss placement.  
4. **Midpoint Exit:** Exits trades at the midpoint of the breached liquidity zone for partial profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when price breaches the *low* of the previous 5 sessions with declining volume.  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when price breaches the *high* of the previous 5 sessions with declining volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Exit at the midpoint of the breached liquidity zone (high/low range).  
2. **Stop-Loss:** 2x ATR from the entry price (trailing stop optional for aggressive management).  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Close trade if target/stop not hit within a set session (e.g., 4 hours).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade relative to the ATR stop.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false liquidity breaches.  
- Filter trades with a volatility check (e.g., only trade if ATR > session average).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **5-Session High/Low:** To define liquidity zones.  
2. **Volume Indicator:** To confirm declining volume during breaches.  
3. **ATR (14-period):** For stop-loss and volatility filtering.  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines liquidity zones (institutional levels) with volume divergence for high-probability reversals.  
- Midpoint exit ensures profit capture before potential pullbacks.  
- ATR adapts stops to current volatility, reducing whipsaw losses.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different session lengths (e.g., 3-7 sessions) for liquidity zones.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5x-3x) based on asset volatility.  
- Add a confirmation filter (e.g., RSI divergence) for higher accuracy.
