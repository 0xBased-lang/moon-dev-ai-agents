STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction with directional momentum confirmation through a unique synthesis of the Vortex Indicator, Bollinger Band analysis, and volume spikes.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+/VI-) - Primary directional signal
2. Bollinger Band Width - Volatility contraction filter
3. Volume Spike - Confirmation of breakout validity
4. ATR - Dynamic stop-loss mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VI+ must cross above VI- (bullish momentum signal)
2. Volatility Filter: Bollinger Band Width must be below its 10-day average (volatility squeeze)
3. Volume Confirmation: Current volume must exceed 2x the 20-day median volume
All three conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: VI- crosses back above VI+ (momentum reversal signal)
2. Protective Stop: 1.5x ATR from entry price (volatility-adjusted stop)
3. Optional Profit Target: None specified (trailing stop approach recommended)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the ATR stop distance
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. No new entries if current position is active
4. Consider implementing a maximum daily loss limit

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+/VI-) - Default 14-period recommended
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with Width calculation
3. Volume (20-day median calculation)
4. Average True Range (ATR) - 14-period recommended

Optimization Considerations:
1. Test different Bollinger Band periods for squeeze detection
2. Experiment with volume multiplier (1.5x-3x range)
3. Adjust ATR multiplier based on market conditions
4. Consider adding time-of-day filters for certain markets

Unique Advantages:
1. Combines momentum, volatility, and volume confirmation
2. Works particularly well in transitioning markets
3. Volatility filter reduces false breakouts
4. Volume confirmation adds validity to signals

Implementation Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
2. Works across multiple asset classes
3. Requires clean, gap-free data for accurate signals
4. Backtest across different market regimes for robustness
