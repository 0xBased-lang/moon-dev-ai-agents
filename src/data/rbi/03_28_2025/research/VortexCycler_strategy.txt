STRATEGY_NAME: VortexCycler

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Components:
1. Primary Trend Filter: Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) cycles identify the underlying trend phase
2. Signal Generator: Vortex Indicator (VI) crossover system (VI+ crossing VI-)
3. Exit Conditions: VI- reversal signal or volume contraction below 50-day average
4. Trend Confirmation: Requires DPO to be in uptrend phase for valid entries

Indicator Requirements:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) with standard 14-period setting
2. Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) with 20-period setting
3. Volume 50-day simple moving average

Entry Rules:
1. DPO must be above its centerline (confirming uptrend phase)
2. VI+ line must cross above VI- line
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously
4. Entry occurs at the next candle's open after confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: VI- line crosses above VI+ line (trend reversal signal)
2. Secondary Exit: Current volume drops below 50-day volume average (momentum warning)
3. Whichever condition occurs first triggers the exit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss placed below recent swing low (for long positions)
3. Trailing stop option: Move stop to breakeven when price moves 2x ATR in profit
4. Maximum trade duration: 20 bars (prevents holding through potential cycle turns)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test DPO period between 15-25 for different instruments
2. VI period can be adjusted between 10-20 based on volatility
3. Volume filter sensitivity can be modified (40-60 day average)

Unique Aspects:
1. Combines cyclical analysis (DPO) with directional momentum (VI)
2. Uses volume contraction as early warning exit signal
3. Filters out counter-trend VI signals with DPO confirmation
4. Particularly effective in trending markets with clear cycles

Backtesting Recommendations:
1. Test across different asset classes (stocks, forex, commodities)
2. Verify performance in both strong and weak trending conditions
3. Compare results with and without volume filter
4. Assess drawdown characteristics during ranging markets
