STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySynchron  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Breakout Focus:** The strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility (compression) followed by high volatility (expansion), using the Keltner Channel squeeze as a primary filter.  
2. **Normalized Indicators:** Combines Keltner Channel squeeze (volatility) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) divergence (momentum) to confirm high-probability breakout setups.  
3. **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Adjusts trade size based on recent realized volatility (e.g., ATR or standard deviation) to align risk with current market conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Keltner Squeeze Confirmation:** Wait for the Bollinger Band (or Keltner Channel) width to reach a multi-period low (e.g., lowest in 20 bars), signaling compression.  
2. **CMF Divergence:** Look for bullish divergence (price makes lower lows while CMF makes higher lows) for long entries or bearish divergence for short entries.  
3. **Breakout Trigger:** Enter on a close outside the Keltner Channel (upper for long, lower for short) with above-average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Use a multiple of recent ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) or a trailing stop based on volatility.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place initial stop at the opposite Keltner Channel boundary or a recent swing low/high.  
3. **Time Exit:** Exit if the trade doesn’t follow through within 3–5 bars.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1–2%) per trade, adjusted by recent ATR to ensure consistent risk exposure.  
2. **Maximum Drawdown Cap:** Halt trading if account drawdown exceeds a threshold (e.g., 5–10%).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channels** (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width).  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow** (20-period).  
3. **ATR** (14-period) for volatility measurement and position sizing.  
4. **Volume** (to confirm breakout validity).  

**Unique Edge:** The "VolatilitySynchron" strategy synchronizes volatility compression (Keltner squeeze) with money flow divergence (CMF) to identify high-probability breakouts, while dynamic sizing ensures adaptability to changing market conditions.
