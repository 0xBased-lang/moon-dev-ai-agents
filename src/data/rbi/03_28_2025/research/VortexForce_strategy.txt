STRATEGY_NAME: VortexForce  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Identifies trend direction and strength.  
   - VI+ > VI- suggests bullish trend.  
   - VI- > VI+ suggests bearish trend.  
2. **Elder Force Index (EFI):** Measures volume-backed price movement to confirm divergence.  
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows, EFI makes higher lows.  
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs, EFI makes lower highs.  
3. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** Signals overbought/oversold conditions for exits.  
   - Thresholds: 70 (overbought), 30 (oversold).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  2. EFI shows bullish divergence (rising EFI while price declines).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  2. EFI shows bearish divergence (falling EFI while price rallies).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** CMO crosses below 70 (overbought reversal).  
- **Short Exit:** CMO crosses above 30 (oversold reversal).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss: Place below recent swing low (long) or above swing high (short).  
- Position sizing: Risk â‰¤1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. Elder Force Index (EFI, typically 13-period).  
3. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO, 20-period).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend (Vortex), volume (EFI), and momentum (CMO) for high-probability convergence signals, reducing whipsaws.
