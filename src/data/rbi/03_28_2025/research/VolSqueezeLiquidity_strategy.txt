STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeLiquidity  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility (compression) before potential explosive moves.  
2. **Negative Funding Rates:** Signals excessive short positioning, increasing the likelihood of a short squeeze.  
3. **Liquidity Gaps:** Targets areas where recent liquidations occurred, acting as natural profit-taking zones.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup Confirmation:**  
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2) show width contraction (squeeze), defined as bandwidth < X% of recent average (adjustable parameter).  
   - Funding rates turn significantly negative (e.g., below -0.01% per 8h).  
2. **Trigger:**  
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with volume surge (> Y% of recent average).  
   - Confirm RSI (14) is not overbought (>70) to avoid false breakouts.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:**  
   - Nearest liquidity gap (recent high/low with clustered liquidations) or 1.5x the Bollinger Band width.  
2. **Stop Loss:**  
   - Below the breakout candle’s low (for longs) or trailing stop at lower Bollinger Band.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size: 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Maximum drawdown per day: 5%.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., weekends).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2).  
2. Funding rate data (platform-specific).  
3. RSI (14) for overbought/oversold context.  
4. Volume oscillator (to confirm breakout strength).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression, crowd sentiment (funding rates), and liquidity hunting—a trifecta for high-probability breakout trades.
