STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) and 20-day historical volatility to identify contraction periods
2. Squeeze Detection: Identifies when Bollinger Band width falls below historical volatility threshold
3. Breakout Confirmation: Uses 2x ATR (14-period) from squeeze range for entry/exit signals

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- When price breaks ABOVE upper Bollinger Band after a confirmed squeeze (BB width < HV)
- Confirmation: Close > upper BB + (2 x ATR)
- Entry: Next candle open after confirmation

SHORT ENTRY:
- When price breaks BELOW lower Bollinger Band after a confirmed squeeze (BB width < HV)
- Confirmation: Close < lower BB - (2 x ATR)
- Entry: Next candle open after confirmation

Exit Rules:
LONG EXIT:
- When price closes below entry price - (2 x ATR)
- Or when price closes below lower Bollinger Band

SHORT EXIT:
- When price closes above entry price + (2 x ATR)
- Or when price closes above upper Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Maximum 2% risk per trade
2. Stop Loss: 2x ATR from entry price
3. Trailing Stop: Adjust stop to breakeven when price moves 1x ATR in profit
4. Maximum Drawdown: 10% account limit before strategy pause

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Historical Volatility (20-day)
3. Average True Range (14-period)
4. Price Channel (for squeeze range identification)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ATR multiples (1.5x-3x) for breakout sensitivity
- Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (14-26) and std dev (1.5-2.5)
- Adjust HV lookback period (14-30 days) for different market conditions

Unique Aspects:
- Combines Bollinger Band contraction with historical volatility comparison
- Uses ATR-based dynamic breakout thresholds
- Incorporates both price channel and volatility measurements
- Features asymmetric exit conditions based on volatility expansion
