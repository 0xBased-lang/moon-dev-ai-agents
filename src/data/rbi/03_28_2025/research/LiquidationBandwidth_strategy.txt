STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandwidth  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cluster Level:** Identifies key price zones where liquidations are likely concentrated over a 30-day period, acting as potential support/resistance.  
2. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Measures volatility compression, signaling potential breakout opportunities when bandwidth reaches a 10-day low.  
3. **Keltner Channel Breakout:** Used as an exit signal, indicating volatility expansion and potential trend continuation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when:  
  - Price approaches the 30-day liquidation cluster level (acting as support).  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth contracts to a 10-day low (indicating low volatility and potential breakout).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Close the long position when:  
  - Price breaks out of the Keltner Channel (upper band for long exits), signaling increased volatility and potential trend exhaustion.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) below the liquidation cluster level.  
- **Position Sizing:** Adjust based on volatility (e.g., using ATR to normalize risk per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **30-Day Liquidation Cluster Level** (custom or on-chain data for liquidation zones).  
2. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations) + Bandwidth calculation.  
3. **Keltner Channel** (20-period EMA, 1.5x ATR for bands).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines liquidation-based support with volatility contraction/expansion signals.  
- Uses Bollinger Bandwidth for entry timing and Keltner Channel for exits, creating a clear volatility cycle framework.  

**Note:** Backtest to validate liquidation cluster reliability and adjust bandwidth/Keltner parameters for different assets.
