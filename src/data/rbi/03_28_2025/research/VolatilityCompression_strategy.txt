STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityCompression  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Focus:** The strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme volatility compression, identified by the VIX/realized volatility ratio exceeding 2 standard deviations.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires trading volume to drop below its 20-day average to confirm low participation and potential breakout conditions.  
3. **Mean-Reversion Signal:** Uses the 5-day EMA of the VIX/realized volatility ratio as a dynamic exit threshold.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a trade when:  
  - The **VIX/realized volatility ratio** exceeds **2 standard deviations** above its mean (indicating extreme compression).  
  - **Volume** is below its **20-day moving average** (confirming low activity).  
- Suggested position: **Long** (anticipating a volatility expansion or breakout).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the trade when:  
  - The **VIX/realized volatility ratio crosses below its 5-day EMA** (signaling mean reversion or loss of compression).  
  - Optional: Use a trailing stop or fixed profit target (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk) to lock in gains.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Set below recent swing lows (for longs) or above swing highs (for shorts) to limit downside.  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Avoid Overexposure:** Do not trade during major macroeconomic events that may distort volatility signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VIX/Realized Volatility Ratio** (primary signal).  
2. **20-day Moving Average of Volume** (confirmation filter).  
3. **5-day EMA of VIX/Realized Volatility Ratio** (exit trigger).  
4. **Standard Deviation Bands** (to quantify extremes).  

**Notes:**  
- Best suited for **index futures, ETFs, or high-liquidity options markets**.  
- Backtest for optimal lookback periods for the ratioâ€™s mean/standard deviation.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., support/resistance) to filter false signals.  

This strategy thrives in **low-volatility regimes** and exploits the tendency of volatility to revert to its mean after extreme compression.
