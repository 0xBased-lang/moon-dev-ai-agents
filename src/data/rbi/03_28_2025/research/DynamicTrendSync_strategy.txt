STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicTrendSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicTrendSync strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum strength analysis for high-probability entries and disciplined exits. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to identify strong trending conditions while avoiding overextended markets.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification (EMA Crossover):
   - 50-period EMA crossing above 200-period EMA signals bullish trend establishment
   - The long-term 200-EMA acts as a trend filter
   - The faster 50-EMA provides responsive entry signals

2. Trend Strength Confirmation (ADX):
   - ADX > 25 threshold ensures meaningful trend strength
   - Avoids false signals during weak or ranging markets
   - Confirms the validity of the EMA crossover signal

3. Exit Timing (RSI):
   - RSI crossing below 70 from overbought territory signals potential exhaustion
   - Captures profits before likely pullbacks
   - Prevents holding through extended consolidations

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50-EMA must cross above 200-EMA
2. Confirmation: ADX must be rising and above 25 level
3. Execution: Enter long on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-Taking: Close position when RSI crosses below 70
2. Emergency Exit: If 50-EMA crosses back below 200-EMA (trend reversal)
3. Optional Stop-Loss: 2-3x ATR below entry price for risk management

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Below recent swing low or using volatility-based stops
3. Trade Filter: Only trade when ADX confirms strong trend (above 25)

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Moving Averages (50 & 200 periods)
2. Average Directional Index (ADX, 14-period standard)
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period standard)

Optimization Notes:
- ADX period can be adjusted between 10-20 for more/less sensitivity
- EMA periods can be tested at 30/100 or 40/150 for different timeframes
- RSI threshold can be tightened to 65 for quicker exits or raised to 75 for extended trends

This strategy works best in strongly trending markets and should be avoided during prolonged ranging periods. The combination of trend confirmation (EMA), strength measurement (ADX), and momentum analysis (RSI) creates a robust framework for capturing sustained moves while avoiding false breakouts.
