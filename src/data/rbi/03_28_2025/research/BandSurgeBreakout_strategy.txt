STRATEGY_NAME: BandSurgeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility where the bands are narrowing, often preceding significant price movements.  
2. **Keltner Channel Slope Surge:** Measures a sharp increase in the slope of the Keltner Channel, indicating strengthening momentum.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires a candle to close outside both Bollinger Bands with high volume (1.5x the 20-day average) for validation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Band width must be in contraction (e.g., below a threshold like the 20-period moving average of the width).  
- **Condition 2:** The Keltner Channel slope must show a sharp upward/downward surge (e.g., slope exceeding a predefined angle or rate of change).  
- **Condition 3:** A candle must close outside the Bollinger Bands (upper for long, lower for short) with volume exceeding 1.5x the 20-day average volume.  
- **Entry Point:** Enter on the next candle's open after the breakout confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Set at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width at the time of entry (adjustable based on volatility).  
- **Stop Loss:** Place at the opposite Bollinger Band or the middle line (20-period SMA), whichever is closer.  
- **Trailing Stop:** Optionalâ€”use a percentage or ATR-based trailing stop to lock in profits during strong trends.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop Loss Discipline:** Strict adherence to stop levels to prevent large drawdowns.  
- **Avoid Overcrowded Trades:** Skip entries if volume is suspiciously high (potential manipulation) or if broader market conditions contradict the breakout.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. **Keltner Channel** (20-period EMA, 1.5x ATR for bands).  
3. **Volume** (20-day average as a baseline).  
4. **Slope Calculation** (e.g., linear regression or angle measurement for Keltner Channel).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (Bollinger) with momentum acceleration (Keltner slope).  
- Volume filter reduces false breakouts.  
- Adaptive profit targets based on Bollinger width.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize slope thresholds and profit multiples for specific instruments/timeframes.
