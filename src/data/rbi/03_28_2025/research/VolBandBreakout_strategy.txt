STRATEGY_NAME: VolBand Breakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Convergence:** The strategy focuses on the 3-day VWAP, which smooths price action while accounting for trading volume.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Narrowing:** The Bollinger Band width must be contracting, indicating reduced volatility and potential for a breakout.  
3. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a significant surge in volumeâ€”exceeding the 20-day average volume by two standard deviations.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** When price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band while the 3-day VWAP is converging (flattening or rising slightly).  
- **Short Entry:** When price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band while the 3-day VWAP is converging (flattening or declining slightly).  
- **Volume Confirmation:** The breakout must occur with volume exceeding the 20-day average by two standard deviations.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands or when the VWAP starts diverging from the trend.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop-loss just beyond the opposite Bollinger Band or at a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) from the entry point.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Only trade breakouts with high volume confirmation to filter false signals.  
- Position sizing should be adjusted based on the Bollinger Band width (tighter bands may warrant smaller positions).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or major economic events that could distort volume patterns.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **3-Day VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price)  
2. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 standard deviations)  
3. **20-Day Average Volume + 2 Standard Deviations** (for volume surge confirmation)  

This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume confirmation, and price-weighted momentum for high-probability breakout trades.
