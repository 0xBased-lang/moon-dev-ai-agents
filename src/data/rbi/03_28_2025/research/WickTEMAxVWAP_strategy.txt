STRATEGY_NAME: WickTEMAxVWAP

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Heikin-Ashi candlestick patterns with technical indicators for precise entries and exits. The key components are:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Heikin-Ashi candlestick analysis (4-hour timeframe)
- Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA 20)
- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
- Stochastic RSI (1-hour timeframe for exits)

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Must observe three consecutive bullish Heikin-Ashi candles on 4H chart
- Each consecutive candle must show progressively smaller upper wicks
- TEMA(20) must cross above VWAP simultaneously
- All conditions must be met simultaneously for valid entry

3. EXIT RULES:
- Monitor 1-hour chart for bearish divergence on Stochastic RSI
- Divergence occurs when price makes higher highs while Stochastic RSI makes lower highs
- Exit entire position when divergence is confirmed

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Recommended stop-loss below the lowest point of the three entry candles
- Position size should be calculated based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Consider trailing stop after significant move in your favor

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Heikin-Ashi candles (set chart to display these)
- TEMA (20 period)
- VWAP (standard settings)
- Stochastic RSI (standard 14,3,3 settings on 1H chart)

6. SPECIAL NOTES:
- Works best in trending markets
- Requires patience to wait for all conditions to align
- Best applied to liquid assets with good volume
- Backtest suggested before live implementation

The unique combination of wick analysis with TEMA/VWAP crossover makes this strategy particularly effective at catching strong momentum moves while filtering out false signals. The 1-hour Stochastic RSI divergence exit helps capture profits before major reversals.
