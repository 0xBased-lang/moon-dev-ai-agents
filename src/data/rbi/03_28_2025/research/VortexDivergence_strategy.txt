STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Used to identify trend direction and potential reversals via crossovers of its two lines (VI+ and VI-).  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Measures money flow volume to detect bullish/bearish divergence relative to price action.  
3. **Volume Spike Analysis:** Exits are triggered by abnormal volume spikes signaling exhaustion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend initiation).  
  - CMF shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low, CMF makes higher low).  
  - Confirm with rising volume.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend initiation).  
  - CMF shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high, CMF makes lower high).  
  - Confirm with rising volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (trend reversal signal).  
  - OR volume spike (e.g., 2x average volume) suggests exhaustion.  

- **Short Exit:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (trend reversal signal).  
  - OR volume spike (e.g., 2x average volume) suggests exhaustion.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low (long) or above the swing high (short).  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk â‰¤2% of capital per trade.  
- **Timeframe Suitability:** Best on 1H/4H charts for balance between noise and signal clarity.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) (default period: 14).  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) (default period: 20).  
3. Volume MA (e.g., 20-period SMA) to identify spikes.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend confirmation (VI) with money flow divergence (CMF) for high-probability reversals, filtered by volume dynamics. Avoids choppy markets by requiring dual confirmation.
