STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):**  
   - Tracks directional movement via VI+ (bullish) and VI- (bearish) lines.  
   - Primary signal: VI+ crossing above VI- indicates bullish momentum.  
2. **Volume Surge:**  
   - Confirms strength behind the VI crossover when volume exceeds the 20-day average.  
3. **ATR-Based Exit:**  
   - Uses the 14-day Average True Range (ATR) to set a dynamic profit target (1.5x ATR).  
   - Exit also triggered if VI+ crosses back below VI- (reversal signal).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long when:  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish crossover).  
  2. Current volume > 20-day average volume (confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close position if:  
  1. VI+ crosses back below VI- (momentum reversal).  
  2. Price reaches 1.5x the 14-day ATR from entry (profit-taking).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss: Not explicitly defined; rely on VI reversal or ATR target.  
- Position sizing: Adjust based on ATR to account for volatility (e.g., risk 1-2% of capital per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. 20-day moving average of volume.  
3. 14-day Average True Range (ATR).  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines directional momentum (VI) with volume confirmation, reducing false breakouts.  
- Dynamic exit via ATR adapts to market volatility, locking in gains during strong trends.  

**Note:** Works best in trending markets; may underperform in choppy/range-bound conditions.
