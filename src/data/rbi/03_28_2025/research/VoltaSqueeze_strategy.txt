STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
The **VoltaSqueeze** strategy combines Bollinger Band width analysis with On-Balance Volume (OBV) divergence to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during volatility contractions. This approach capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by explosive moves, using volume confirmation to filter false breakouts.  

### **Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP):**  
   - Measures the relative width of Bollinger Bands (BB) compared to historical values.  
   - A low percentile (e.g., below 20%) indicates a volatility squeeze, suggesting an impending breakout.  

2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Divergence:**  
   - Confirms breakout strength by analyzing volume trends.  
   - Bullish divergence (price makes lower lows, OBV makes higher lows) supports long entries.  
   - Bearish divergence (price makes higher highs, OBV makes lower highs) supports short entries.  

### **Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. BBWP < 20% (volatility squeeze present).  
  2. Price breaks **above** the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. OBV shows bullish divergence (rising OBV while price consolidates or declines).  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. BBWP < 20% (volatility squeeze present).  
  2. Price breaks **below** the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. OBV shows bearish divergence (falling OBV while price rallies).  

### **Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Trailing stop based on Bollinger Band reversion (exit when price closes back inside the bands).  
  - Alternatively, fixed risk-reward (e.g., 2:1).  

- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Initial stop placed at the **opposite band** (for long: lower band; for short: upper band).  
  - Exit if OBV reverses trend (e.g., OBV starts declining after a long entry).  

### **Risk Management:**  
- Position size based on volatility (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid trading during major news events unless confirmed by volume.  

### **Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Percentile** (calculates % rank of current BB width vs. past 100 periods).  
3. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)** (confirms volume trends).  

### **Unique Advantages:**  
- **High-Probability Breakouts:** Filters noise by requiring both a volatility squeeze and volume confirmation.  
- **Trend Continuation Focus:** OBV divergence helps avoid fakeouts.  
- **Adaptive to Market Conditions:** Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends.  

**Best Timeframes:** 1H, 4H, Daily (avoids excessive whipsaws).  
**Asset Classes:** Forex, Stocks, Crypto (works best in liquid markets).  

**Note:** Backtest for optimal BBWP threshold (may vary by asset).
