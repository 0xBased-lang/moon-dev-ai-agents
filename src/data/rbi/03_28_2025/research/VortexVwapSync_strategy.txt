STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVwapSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This intraday breakout strategy combines VWAP dynamics with Vortex Indicator signals for high-probability trades. The core innovation lies in synchronizing slope-based VWAP confirmation with directional Vortex crossovers.

Key Components:
1. VWAP Slope Analysis (Primary Filter)
   - Bullish Setup: Price above rising VWAP (positive slope)
   - Bearish Setup: Price below falling VWAP (negative slope)
   - Slope threshold: Minimum 15-degree angle on 5-min chart

2. Vortex Indicator (Signal Generator)
   - VI+ crossing above VI- for long entries
   - VI- crossing above VI+ for short entries
   - Must occur within 1% of VWAP line

Entry Rules:
Long Entry:
1. VWAP slope >15 degrees upward
2. Price pulls back to VWAP (within 0.5%)
3. VI+ crosses above VI- while above VWAP
4. Confirmed when price breaks recent high

Short Entry:
1. VWAP slope >15 degrees downward
2. Price rallies to VWAP (within 0.5%)
3. VI- crosses above VI+ while below VWAP
4. Confirmed when price breaks recent low

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Opposite Vortex crossover occurs
2. Secondary Exit: Price crosses VWAP ±1.5% dynamic band
3. Emergency Exit: 2% adverse move from entry

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop placement: 
   - Longs: Below recent swing low or 1% below entry
   - Shorts: Above recent swing high or 1% above entry
3. Time filter: Only trade first 6 hours of session
4. Max trades/day: 3 per direction

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) with slope measurement
2. Vortex Indicator (14-period standard settings)
3. Dynamic bands at ±1.5% from VWAP

Optimization Notes:
- Best performance in high-volume index ETFs (SPY, QQQ)
- Ideal timeframe: 5-minute charts
- Requires minimum $25 average true range
- Avoid first 30 minutes after open

This strategy capitalizes on the synergy between institutional VWAP flows and directional momentum from the Vortex Indicator, creating a robust intraday trading framework.
