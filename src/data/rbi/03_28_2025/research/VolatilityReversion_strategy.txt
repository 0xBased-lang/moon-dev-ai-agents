STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility term structure analysis with statistical mean-reversion principles for trading SPX. The approach specifically waits for VIX backwardation (a rare volatility market condition) to signal potential mean-reversion opportunities when price deviates significantly from its short-term average.

Key Components:
1. VIX Term Structure: Monitors the relationship between front-month and later-month VIX futures
2. Statistical Deviation: Uses 2 standard deviations from 20-day SMA as threshold
3. Dual Exit Mechanism: Incorporates both price reversion and volatility contraction signals

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VIX term structure must be in backwardation (front-month > later-month)
2. Secondary Condition: SPX price must be >2 standard deviations away from 20-day SMA
3. Entry Direction: Short if price is above SMA, long if below SMA

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price returns to within 0.5 standard deviations of 20-day SMA
2. Secondary Exit: When VIX term structure returns to contango (front-month < later-month)
3. Whichever condition occurs first triggers exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: 3 standard deviations from entry point
3. Time Exit: Close position after 5 trading days if neither exit condition triggers

Required Indicators:
1. 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of SPX
2. 20-day Standard Deviation of SPX
3. VIX futures term structure (front-month vs next-month)
4. Bollinger Bands (for visualization of deviation)

Special Considerations:
- This strategy works best during periods of market stress when volatility spikes
- Requires monitoring of VIX futures roll dates
- May have extended periods without signals during stable markets
- Combines both volatility regime analysis and statistical mean-reversion

Optimization Notes:
- Can test different SMA periods (15-25 days)
- May adjust deviation threshold (1.8-2.2Ïƒ)
- Could incorporate volume confirmation for entries
