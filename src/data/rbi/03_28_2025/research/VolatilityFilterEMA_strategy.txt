STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFilterEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend identification with volatility filtering to capture stable trends while avoiding high-volatility periods. The key components are:

1. Trend Identification:
- Uses the classic 50/200 EMA crossover system (Golden Cross)
- Long positions only triggered when 50 EMA > 200 EMA
- No short positions in this version

2. Volatility Filter:
- Uses Average True Range (ATR) to measure market volatility
- Requires low volatility for entry (current ATR below its 20-day average)
- Exits when volatility spikes (current ATR > 20-day ATR average)

3. Entry Rules:
- Wait for 50-period EMA to cross above 200-period EMA
- Confirm current ATR is below its 20-day average
- Enter long position at market price

4. Exit Rules:
- Monitor ATR daily
- Exit position when current ATR rises above its 20-day average
- No trailing stop or profit target (volatility-based exit only)

5. Risk Management:
- Position sizing should account for the ATR values
- Consider using ATR-based stop loss (e.g., 2x current ATR)
- No re-entry until ATR drops back below average and EMAs remain bullish

6. Required Indicators:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Average True Range (ATR) with 20-day average calculation

7. Ideal Market Conditions:
- Works best in trending markets
- Avoids choppy or highly volatile periods
- Particularly effective in steady bull markets

8. Timeframe Considerations:
- Designed for daily charts
- Can be adapted to 4-hour charts with parameter adjustments
- Not recommended for very short timeframes

9. Strengths:
- Reduces whipsaws during volatile periods
- Captures sustained trends
- Simple rule-based approach

10. Weaknesses:
- May miss early trend entries during volatile breakouts
- Requires patience during low volatility periods
- No short-side implementation in basic version

Implementation Notes:
- Backtest different ATR periods (14-day vs 20-day)
- Consider adding volume confirmation
- May combine with RSI for overbought/oversold filtering
- Works well as part of a diversified portfolio
