STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicTrendSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicTrendSurge strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum strength analysis to capture sustained directional moves while avoiding overbought conditions. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to identify high-probability entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification (EMA Crossover):
   - 50-period EMA crossing above 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) establishes the bullish trend foundation
   - This long-term moving average crossover filters out false signals and confirms the broader trend direction

2. Trend Strength (ADX Filter):
   - Requires ADX (14-period) > 25 to confirm strong trending conditions
   - Maintains position while ADX remains above 20, exiting when trend weakens

3. Momentum Extremes (RSI Exit):
   - Uses RSI (14-period) > 70 as overbought exit signal
   - Prevents holding positions during potential reversals from extended moves

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50-EMA > 200-EMA (crossover confirmed)
2. Secondary Confirmation: ADX > 25 and rising
3. Entry Trigger: Next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking/Overbought Exit: RSI > 70
2. Trend Weakness Exit: ADX < 20
3. Stop-loss: Optional trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR below price)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk parameters (1-2% per trade recommended)
2. Optional stop-loss placement below recent swing low
3. Avoid entering when price is already extended (consider distance from EMAs)

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Moving Averages (50 and 200 periods)
2. Average Directional Index (ADX 14-period)
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI 14-period)
4. Optional: Average True Range (ATR) for stop placement

Optimization Notes:
- EMA periods can be adjusted for different timeframes (e.g., 20/50 for shorter timeframes)
- ADX threshold can be tested between 20-30 depending on market volatility
- RSI exit level can be adjusted to 75 for stronger trends or 65 for more conservative exits

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals during ranging conditions. Traders should combine with price action analysis for additional confirmation.
