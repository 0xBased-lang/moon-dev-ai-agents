STRATEGY_NAME: ContrarianDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Contrarian Approach:** The strategy takes positions opposite to the prevailing market sentiment when extreme funding rates are detected.  
2. **Funding Rate Extremes:** Uses +/-2 standard deviations from the mean funding rate to identify overbought (positive extreme) or oversold (negative extreme) conditions.  
3. **RSI Divergence:** Confirms entries with bearish (price higher highs, RSI lower highs) or bullish (price lower lows, RSI higher lows) divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).  
4. **Mean Reversion Exit:** Exits trades when funding rates revert to their 7-day mean, signaling a normalization of sentiment.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Perpetual funding rate exceeds +2 standard deviations (overbought).  
  - Bearish RSI divergence is present (price makes higher highs, RSI makes lower highs).  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Perpetual funding rate falls below -2 standard deviations (oversold).  
  - Bullish RSI divergence is present (price makes lower lows, RSI makes higher lows).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close the position when the funding rate crosses back to its 7-day simple moving average (SMA).  
- Optional: Use a trailing stop or fixed profit target (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk) to secure gains if the mean reversion is delayed.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for volatility (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Stop-loss placed beyond recent swing highs (for shorts) or swing lows (for longs) to avoid premature exits.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or major news events that may distort funding rates.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Funding Rate Standard Deviation Bands:** Calculate the mean and +/-2 standard deviations of funding rates over a lookback period (e.g., 30 days).  
2. **RSI (14-period):** To identify divergence against price action.  
3. **7-day SMA of Funding Rate:** For exit conditions.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines sentiment extremes (funding rates) with technical confirmation (RSI divergence).  
- Focuses on mean reversion in funding rates rather than price, reducing reliance on traditional overbought/oversold indicators.  
- Works best in trending markets where funding rate extremes align with exhaustion points.  

**Note:** Backtest for optimal lookback periods (e.g., 30 days for funding rate stats) and validate divergence sensitivity (e.g., 14-period RSI).
