STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume analysis, and funding rate dynamics to identify high-probability breakout opportunities in cryptocurrency markets.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channel Compression: Uses narrowing Keltner Channels (typically 20-period EMA with 2x ATR bands) to identify consolidation phases
2. Volume Confirmation: Requires declining volume during the consolidation period
3. Funding Rate Divergence: Looks for sudden positive spikes in funding rates as confirmation
4. Breakout Trigger: Entry occurs when price breaks channel boundaries with supporting volume

Entry Rules:
1. Identify when Keltner Channels have narrowed to at least 50% of their 20-period average width
2. Confirm volume has been declining during the consolidation (use 20-period volume MA)
3. Wait for funding rate to show sudden positive divergence (minimum 0.01% increase from 4-period baseline)
4. Enter long on breakout above upper Keltner band with volume exceeding 20-period average
5. Enter short on breakdown below lower Keltner band with volume exceeding 20-period average

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: 
   - 1.5x the Keltner Channel width at breakout point
   - OR when opposite channel boundary is touched
2. Stop Loss: 
   - For longs: below the breakout candle low or lower Keltner band
   - For shorts: above the breakout candle high or upper Keltner band

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Minimum 1:1.5 risk-reward ratio required

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2x ATR multiplier)
2. Volume (20-period MA)
3. Funding Rate indicator (with 4-period baseline)
4. ATR (14-period for volatility measurement)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different Keltner Channel periods (14-30) and multipliers (1.5-2.5)
2. Adjust volume confirmation thresholds based on asset liquidity
3. Fine-tune funding rate divergence sensitivity based on market conditions

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases, particularly effective in altcoins with strong funding rate dynamics. The combination of technical compression and funding rate confirmation provides a robust filter against false breakouts.
