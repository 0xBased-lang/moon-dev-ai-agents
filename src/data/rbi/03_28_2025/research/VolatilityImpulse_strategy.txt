STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityImpulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum and volatility analysis with trend confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The unique aspect lies in using a dynamic volatility-based threshold for the Chande Momentum Oscillator, coupled with Elder's Impulse System for trend confirmation and exit signals.

Key Components:
1. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) - Measures momentum strength
2. Dynamic Threshold - 1.5x 20-day rolling volatility (ATR or standard deviation)
3. Elder's Impulse System - Combines EMA and MACD for trend confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Calculate the dynamic threshold as 1.5 times the 20-day volatility measure
2. Wait for CMO to cross ABOVE this dynamic threshold
3. Confirm with Elder's Impulse System showing bullish signal (green bar)
4. Enter long position when all conditions align

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When Elder's Impulse System shows bearish reversal (red bar)
2. Secondary Exit: If CMO falls back below the dynamic threshold
3. Emergency Exit: Pre-determined stop-loss level (recommend 1x ATR below entry)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (recommend 1-2% risk per trade)
2. Stop-loss at 1x 20-day ATR below entry price
3. Consider trailing stop based on recent swing lows
4. Avoid trading during low volatility periods (when threshold < absolute value 10)

Required Indicators:
1. Chande Momentum Oscillator (standard 20-period)
2. 20-day volatility measure (ATR or standard deviation)
3. Elder's Impulse System (13-day EMA + MACD histogram)

Optimization Notes:
- The 1.5x multiplier can be adjusted between 1.2-2.0 based on asset volatility
- For more sensitive signals, reduce CMO period to 14
- For smoother signals, increase CMO period to 25
- Combine with volume confirmation for higher accuracy

This strategy works best in trending markets and may generate false signals during ranging periods. The dynamic threshold adapts to changing market conditions, while Elder's system provides reliable trend confirmation.
