STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySpikeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility-adjusted price levels with liquidity-based volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during low-liquidity market conditions.

Key Components:
1. Volatility-adjusted VWAP bands (2 standard deviations)
2. Low-liquidity time filter (typically overnight or lunch hours)
3. Volume spike confirmation (150% of 15-period median)
4. 3-minute timeframe for volume confirmation

Indicators Required:
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) with 2 standard deviation bands
2. Volume indicator with 15-period median calculation
3. Time-based filter for low-liquidity periods

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to break outside the 2-standard deviation VWAP band
2. Confirm the breakout with a volume spike (150% of 15-period median) within 3 minutes
3. Entry occurs on the close of the 3-minute bar that confirms the volume spike
4. Trade must occur during predefined low-liquidity hours

Exit Rules:
1. Initial stop-loss placed at the opposite VWAP band (2 standard deviations)
2. Take-profit set at 1.5x the initial risk (distance from entry to stop)
3. Trailing stop activated after price reaches 1x risk, trailing at 0.5 standard deviations

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum of 3 concurrent positions open
3. No trading during high-impact news events
4. Daily loss limit of 5% of account

Additional Notes:
- Low-liquidity hours should be backtested for the specific instrument
- Volume spike threshold may need adjustment based on market conditions
- Works best on liquid instruments with consistent overnight sessions (forex, futures)
- Requires monitoring of economic calendar for potential news interference
