STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentKeltner

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines technical channel breakouts with on-chain flow divergence to identify high-probability reversal opportunities. The unique combination of price channel dynamics with blockchain liquidity movements creates a robust filter against false breakouts.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA with 2.5x ATR bands)
2. Exchange Netflow (30-day moving average)
3. Parabolic SAR (0.02 step, 0.2 maximum)

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price closes BELOW lower Keltner band
   - Simultaneous POSITIVE 30-day netflow (coins moving to cold storage)
   - SAR must be below price (downtrend confirmation)

2. Short Entry:
   - Price closes ABOVE upper Keltner band
   - Simultaneous NEGATIVE 30-day netflow (coins moving to exchanges)
   - SAR must be above price (uptrend confirmation)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit:
   - SAR reversal (when dots flip to opposite side of price)
   
2. Emergency Exit:
   - Price reaches 1.5x ATR beyond opposite channel band
   - Netflow divergence disappears for 3 consecutive periods

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop placement: 
   - Longs: 1 ATR below entry candle low
   - Shorts: 1 ATR above entry candle high
3. Maximum portfolio exposure: 15% across all positions

Indicator Settings:
1. Keltner Channel:
   - EMA Period: 20
   - ATR Multiplier: 2.5
   - ATR Period: 20

2. Exchange Netflow:
   - MA Period: 30 days
   - Threshold: Â±0.5% of circulating supply

3. Parabolic SAR:
   - Step: 0.02
   - Maximum: 0.2

Optimization Notes:
- Test ATR multipliers between 2.0-3.0 for different volatility regimes
- Adjust netflow MA period (20-50 days) based on asset liquidity
- SAR parameters may need tightening for faster-moving assets

This strategy works best on 4H-1D timeframes for crypto assets with reliable on-chain data. The netflow divergence acts as a powerful confirmation filter, while the Keltner bands identify extreme moves likely to reverse when contradicted by smart money flows.
