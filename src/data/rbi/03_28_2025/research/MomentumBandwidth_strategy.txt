STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBandwidth  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** A momentum indicator that measures the strength of price movement, ranging from -100 to +100.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width:** Measures the volatility by calculating the difference between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands, normalized by the middle band.  
3. **20-Day Low in Bandwidth:** Identifies periods of low volatility, often preceding potential breakouts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - CMO crosses **above** a predefined threshold (e.g., +50)  
  - Bollinger Band width is at a **20-day low** (indicating compressed volatility)  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - CMO crosses **below** a predefined threshold (e.g., -50)  
  - Bollinger Band width is at a **20-day low**  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - CMO crosses **below** a neutral threshold (e.g., +20)  
  - OR Bollinger Band width expands significantly (e.g., above a moving average of bandwidth)  
- **Short Exit:**  
  - CMO crosses **above** a neutral threshold (e.g., -20)  
  - OR Bollinger Band width expands significantly  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) below/above entry price  
  - OR volatility-based stop using ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR)  
- **Position Sizing:**  
  - Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)** – Typically with a 14-period lookback.  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – Standard settings for calculating bandwidth.  
3. **Bollinger Band Width Formula:**  
   \[  
   \text{Bandwidth} = \frac{\text{Upper Band} - \text{Lower Band}}{\text{Middle Band (SMA 20)}}  
   \]  
4. **Optional:** ATR (14-period) for dynamic stop-loss adjustment.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **momentum confirmation (CMO)** with **volatility compression (Bandwidth)** for high-probability breakout entries.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring both momentum and low volatility conditions.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Adjust CMO thresholds (+50/-50) based on asset volatility.  
- Test different bandwidth lookback periods (e.g., 10-30 days) for optimal compression detection.  

This strategy is ideal for **swing trading** in trending markets with periodic volatility contractions.
