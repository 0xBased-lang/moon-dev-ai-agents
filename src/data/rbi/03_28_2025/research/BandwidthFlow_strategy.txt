STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthFlow  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 20-day low, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Confirms buying pressure when CMF crosses above zero, indicating accumulation and bullish momentum.  
3. **Exit Conditions:** Uses a dynamic 5% trailing stop to lock in profits and exits when volatility increases (Bandwidth expands beyond its 10-day average).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when both conditions are met:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth contracts to a 20-day low (volatility squeeze).  
  - Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) crosses above zero (bullish money flow confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop Exit:** Close the position if the price retraces 5% from its highest point since entry.  
- **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Exit when Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond its 10-day average, signaling increased volatility and potential trend exhaustion.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- The 5% trailing stop ensures controlled downside risk while allowing for upside potential.  
- Avoid entering during high market noise or when CMF is weakly positive (below +0.05).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** To calculate Bandwidth (Upper Band - Lower Band / Middle Band).  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (20-period):** For volume-weighted money flow confirmation.  
3. **Trailing Stop (5%):** Dynamic exit to protect profits.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or consolidating markets; avoid strong trending phases without pullbacks.  
- Backtest for optimal Bandwidth lookback periods (e.g., 20-day vs. 14-day) and CMF thresholds.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., candle closes above Band squeeze) for higher accuracy.  

This strategy capitalizes on volatility cycles and money flow shifts, balancing aggression (squeeze entries) with discipline (trailing stops).
