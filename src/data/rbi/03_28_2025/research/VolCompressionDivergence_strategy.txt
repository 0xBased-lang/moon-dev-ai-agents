STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressionDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Percentile Rank (<10%)**: Identifies periods of extreme volatility compression, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Put/Call Ratio Divergence Surge**: Detects a sudden increase in bearish sentiment (rising put/call ratio) diverging from price action, suggesting an impending reversal or breakout.  
3. **2x Daily Range Target**: Defines a clear profit-taking exit based on volatility expansion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger when **Bollinger Band width percentile rank** drops below 10% (indicating extreme compression).  
- Confirm with a **surge in put/call ratio divergence** (e.g., 20%+ increase over a short period, diverging from price stability or uptrend).  
- Enter on a **break of the prior dayâ€™s high/low** (direction depends on put/call divergence: short if put/call spikes, long if call/put spikes).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target**: 2x the average true range (ATR) of the last 5 days.  
- **Stop-Loss**: 1x ATR from entry or a close beyond the opposite Bollinger Band.  
- **Time Exit**: Close position after 3 days if target not hit.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size capped at 2% of capital per trade.  
- No overlapping trades in correlated assets.  
- Avoid earnings/events that may distort volatility.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** + width percentile rank (14-period lookback).  
2. **Put/Call Ratio** (with 5-day MA to identify surges).  
3. **ATR (5)** for dynamic exit sizing.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines mechanical volatility signals with sentiment divergence, targeting explosive moves after low-volatility regimes.
