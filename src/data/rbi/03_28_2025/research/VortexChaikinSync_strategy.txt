STRATEGY_NAME: VortexChaikinSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines two powerful momentum indicators - the Vortex Indicator and Chaikin Oscillator - to create a high-probability trading system. The unique synchronization between these indicators provides robust confirmation of momentum shifts while filtering out false signals.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines) - Measures directional movement
2. Chaikin Oscillator - Combines price and volume momentum
3. Strict crossover rules for entries
4. Dual confirmation for exits

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Signal: VI+ line crosses above VI- line (bullish momentum)
2. Confirmation: Chaikin Oscillator must be above zero and rising
3. Both conditions must occur within the same candlestick period
4. Entry occurs at the open of the next candle after confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: VI+ crosses back below VI- (momentum reversal)
2. Secondary Exit: Bearish divergence on Chaikin Oscillator (price makes higher high while oscillator makes lower high)
3. More aggressive exit: Chaikin Oscillator crosses below zero
4. Whichever exit condition triggers first closes the position

Risk Management:
1. Fixed percentage stop-loss (recommended 1-2% of capital)
2. Trailing stop based on recent swing low (adjusts with position)
3. Position sizing based on stop distance and risk tolerance
4. Time-based exit if position doesn't move favorably within 3-5 periods

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (standard 14-period setting)
2. Chaikin Oscillator (3,10 period EMA settings recommended)
3. Optional: Volume indicator to confirm Chaikin signals

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trading
- Avoid trading during low volume periods
- Strongest signals occur when both indicators align with overall trend direction
- Backtest recommended for specific asset volatility characteristics

This VortexChaikinSync strategy provides a systematic approach to momentum trading with built-in confirmation filters, making it particularly effective in trending markets while reducing whipsaw losses in ranging conditions.
