STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBandBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines on-chain liquidity analysis with technical indicators to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during periods of market consolidation.

Key Components:
1. On-chain liquidation clusters (high liquidity zones)
2. Bollinger Band Width contraction (measure of volatility compression)
3. Liquidity pool levels (key price targets)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band Width to contract below 0.5 (indicating low volatility)
2. Identify nearest high liquidation cluster from on-chain data (price zone with dense stop orders)
3. Enter long when price breaks above the upper liquidation cluster boundary with confirmation candle close
4. Enter short when price breaks below the lower liquidation cluster boundary with confirmation candle close

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit at the next significant liquidity pool level (identified from on-chain data)
2. Stop loss placed at the opposite side of the broken liquidation cluster
3. Alternative exit if Bollinger Bands expand significantly (width > 1.5) without reaching target

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss distance determines position size (risk no more than 0.5% per trade)
3. Avoid trading during major news events when liquidity patterns may be unreliable
4. Maximum 3 concurrent positions open

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with Width calculation
2. On-chain liquidation heatmap (showing cluster density)
3. Liquidity pool levels (from order book analysis)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best timeframes: 4H and daily charts
2. Most effective in ranging markets transitioning to trends
3. Works well with major crypto pairs (BTC, ETH) due to reliable on-chain data
4. Requires real-time liquidation cluster updates for best results

This strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency to target liquidity zones after periods of low volatility, using on-chain data to identify the most probable breakout directions and targets.
