STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeSpike

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume spikes to identify potential breakout opportunities, using Keltner Channels for exit signals.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction: Measures periods of low volatility
2. Volume Spike Filter: Confirms breakout potential with increased participation
3. Keltner Channel Exit: Provides dynamic exit points based on volatility expansion

Entry Rules:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) must contract below 50% of its 100-day median value
   - BBW = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band
   - Calculate 100-day median of BBW
   - Current BBW must be < 50% of this median
2. Volume must spike above 2x the 30-day average volume
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously on the same 5-minute bar

Exit Rules:
1. Close position on first 5-minute close outside the outer Keltner Channel band
   - Use standard Keltner Channel settings (20-period EMA with 2x ATR)
   - Exit on close above upper band (long positions) or below lower band (short positions)

Risk Management:
1. Recommended position sizing: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Optional stop-loss: 1.5x ATR below entry for long positions (adjust for volatility)
3. Time-based exit: Consider exiting if no breakout occurs within 3 bars

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth calculation
3. Volume 30-day moving average
4. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2x ATR)
5. ATR (14-period for Keltner Channels)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases
- Avoid using during strong trending markets (may get false signals)
- Combine with price action confirmation for better accuracy
- Optimal timeframes: 5-minute to 1-hour charts
- Backtest suggested for specific asset volatility characteristics

This "VolatilitySqueezeSpike" strategy capitalizes on the explosive potential when low volatility periods (Bollinger squeeze) coincide with sudden volume increases, while using Keltner Channels to capture the subsequent momentum move.
