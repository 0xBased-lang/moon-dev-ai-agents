STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy specializes in detecting potential liquidation cascades by combining funding rate analysis with technical indicators, focusing on high-leverage market conditions.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Divergence - Identifies when funding rates diverge from price action, signaling potential overleveraged positions
2. Bollinger Band Breakouts - Uses volatility expansion to confirm cascade conditions
3. RSI Oversold Threshold - Provides exit signals when markets stabilize
4. Leverage Cluster Detection - Focuses on areas with concentrated high leverage positions

Entry Rules:
1. SHORT when:
   - Funding rate shows negative divergence (rising rates while price stagnates/rises)
   - Price breaks below lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 std dev)
   - RSI crosses below 30 (confirming oversold conditions)
   - Volume spikes above 20-period average

Exit Rules:
1. Cover short when:
   - RSI crosses back above 35 from oversold territory
   - Price closes back inside Bollinger Bands
   - Funding rate normalizes (returns to mean or shows positive convergence)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (ATR-based)
2. Hard stop-loss at 2x Bollinger Band width below entry
3. Time-based exit if no cascade occurs within 3 candles
4. Avoid trading during low liquidity periods (as per volume indicator)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. RSI (14 period)
3. Volume (20-period MA)
4. Funding Rate indicator (with divergence detection)
5. ATR (14 period for volatility measurement)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in altcoin markets with high leverage ratios
- Most effective during periods of high market stress
- Requires real-time funding rate data feed
- Should be combined with exchange liquidation heatmap data for best results

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust Bollinger Band parameters based on asset volatility
- Fine-tune RSI thresholds for different crypto assets
- Incorporate liquidation level clustering analysis if available
