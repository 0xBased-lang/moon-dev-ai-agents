STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicRebound  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Rebound:** Identifies potential long entries when price bounces off the lower Bollinger Band, signaling oversold conditions.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) Confirmation:** Requires CMF to spike above its 10-day SMA, indicating strong buying pressure.  
3. **Donchian Channel Volatility Filter:** Uses the midline of the Donchian channel to detect volatility contraction, acting as an exit signal.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **long** when:  
  1. Price touches or rebounds from the **lower Bollinger Band**.  
  2. **CMF** crosses above its **10-day SMA** (confirming bullish momentum).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Exit at the **upper Bollinger Band** (mean reversion target).  
- **Stop Loss or Early Exit:** Exit if price breaks the **Donchian channel midline**, signaling reduced volatility or trend weakness.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).  
2. **Stop Loss:** Optional trailing stop below the recent swing low or lower Bollinger Band.  
3. **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trades if the Donchian channel width is too narrow (e.g., bottom 20% of recent range).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 Std Dev).  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow** (20-period, with 10-day SMA overlay).  
3. **Donchian Channel** (20-period midline).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines mean reversion (Bollinger) with momentum (CMF) and volatility contraction (Donchian) for high-probability reversals. The name "VoltaicRebound" reflects the explosive (voltaic) nature of the rebound setup.
