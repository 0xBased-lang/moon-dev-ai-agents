STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands width contraction with Chaikin Oscillator divergence to identify high-probability breakout opportunities with volume confirmation. The approach capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by momentum shifts indicated by money flow divergence.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) - Identifies contraction periods when bandwidth narrows significantly
2. Chaikin Oscillator (3,10) - Detects bullish/bearish divergence from price action
3. Volume - Confirms breakout validity

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- Bollinger Band width contracts to lowest 20% of recent range
- Price makes higher low while Chaikin Oscillator makes lower low (bullish divergence)
- Price breaks above upper band with above-average volume
- Stop loss placed at lower band or recent swing low

SHORT ENTRY:
- Bollinger Band width contracts to lowest 20% of recent range
- Price makes lower high while Chaikin Oscillator makes higher high (bearish divergence)
- Price breaks below lower band with above-average volume
- Stop loss placed at upper band or recent swing high

Exit Rules:
- Take profit when price crosses back through the middle band (20 SMA)
- Alternative exit when opposite band is touched (for extended trends)
- Chaikin Oscillator crossing zero line can serve as early exit signal

Risk Management:
- Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss mandatory on all positions
- Avoid trading during major news events when bands may expand artificially
- Filter trades to only highest probability setups (clear divergence + volume)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Chaikin Oscillator (3,10 EMA)
3. Volume indicator (preferably VWAP or OBV for confirmation)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Most effective on 1H-4H timeframes
- Ideal for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns

The "BandwidthDivergence" strategy offers a systematic approach to trading breakouts by combining volatility contraction, money flow divergence, and volume confirmation for higher probability setups.
