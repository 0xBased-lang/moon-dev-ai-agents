STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeBreakoutEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines multiple technical indicators to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during periods of consolidation, using EMA crossovers, Bollinger Band squeezes, and volume spikes as key confirmation signals.

Key Components:
1. EMA Crossover Foundation: Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as the primary trend confirmation
2. Bollinger Band Squeeze: Identifies periods of low volatility preceding potential breakouts
3. Volume Spike: Requires 2x the 20-day average volume for confirmation
4. Breakout Entry: Triggers when price breaks out from the squeeze pattern

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 50-EMA to cross above the 200-EMA (Golden Cross formation)
2. Confirm Bollinger Band squeeze (bands within 20% of their narrowest width in past 50 periods)
3. Enter long when price breaks above upper Bollinger Band
4. Volume must be at least 2x the 20-day average volume at breakout

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: 
   - Primary: 2x the Bollinger Band width at time of breakout
   - Secondary: When price closes below the 50-EMA
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Below the lower Bollinger Band at time of entry
   - Or below the most recent swing low before breakout

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Risk-reward ratio minimum 1:2
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Filter out low-volume breakouts (must meet 2x volume requirement)

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
4. 20-day Volume Average

Additional Notes:
- Works best on daily or 4-hour timeframes
- Most effective in trending markets following periods of consolidation
- Requires patience as squeeze formations may take time to develop
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability trades
- Backtest parameters for specific instruments as volatility characteristics vary
