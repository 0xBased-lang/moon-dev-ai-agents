STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityAsymmetry

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated volatility trading strategy that capitalizes on the asymmetry between VIX and VVIX behavior during extreme market conditions. The strategy combines mean-reversion principles with volatility regime analysis.

Key Components:
1. VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) - Primary indicator for market fear
2. VVIX (VIX of VIX) - Measures volatility of volatility
3. 95th percentile threshold - Extreme volatility threshold
4. Median VVIX - Baseline for volatility stability
5. 20-day rolling mean - Mean-reversion target

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger: When VIX closes above its 95th percentile (calculated using 1-year lookback period)
2. Confirmation: VVIX must simultaneously be below its median value (1-year lookback)
3. Execution: Enter long VIX futures position at next open

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When VIX reverts to or below its 20-day simple moving average
2. Secondary Exit: If VVIX rises above its 75th percentile (volatility becoming unstable)
3. Time-based Exit: Maximum 10 trading day hold period

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 2-5% of portfolio per trade
2. Stop Loss: 10% of position value if VIX continues rising beyond entry
3. Maximum Drawdown: 15% portfolio-wide stop
4. Trade Frequency: Limited to 1-2 trades per month to avoid overexposure

Required Indicators:
1. VIX Index (real-time)
2. VVIX Index (real-time)
3. 1-year historical VIX data for percentile calculation
4. 1-year historical VVIX data for median calculation
5. 20-day simple moving average of VIX

Unique Aspects:
- Exploits the divergence between actual volatility (VIX) and volatility expectations (VVIX)
- Combines extreme value analysis with mean-reversion
- Uses VVIX as a stability filter to avoid entering during truly unstable markets
- Particularly effective during "volatility shocks" that don't reflect structural instability

Backtesting Considerations:
- Optimal during periods of market stress (2008, 2020)
- May underperform during prolonged low-volatility regimes
- Requires careful execution due to VIX futures term structure effects
