STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines dynamic volume-weighted pricing with volatility expansion/contraction signals to capture strong momentum moves while avoiding low-volatility periods.

Key Components:
1. Dynamic VWAP Bands (Primary Trigger)
   - Calculated using volume-weighted average price with standard deviation bands
   - Upper/Lower bands adjust based on recent volatility

2. Bollinger Bandwidth Expansion (Confirmation Filter)
   - Measures the percentage difference between upper/lower Bollinger Bands
   - Requires bandwidth to be expanding (increasing) for valid signals

3. Keltner Channel Contraction (Exit Condition)
   - Uses ATR-based channel width
   - Exits when channel width contracts below a rolling N-period average

Entry Rules:
LONG:
- Price closes above upper VWAP band
- Bollinger Bandwidth is expanding (current > previous)
- Volume above 20-period average

SHORT:
- Price closes below lower VWAP band
- Bollinger Bandwidth is expanding (current > previous)
- Volume above 20-period average

Exit Rules:
- Keltner Channel width crosses below its 10-period SMA
- Or fixed 2:1 risk/reward ratio achieved
- Or time-based exit after 5 periods without new highs/lows

Risk Management:
- Initial stop placed at opposite VWAP band
- Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade
- Maximum 5 concurrent positions

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP with Â±1.5 standard deviation bands (20-period lookback)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with bandwidth calculation
3. Keltner Channels (20,1.5) with width calculation
4. Volume average (20-period)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust VWAP band multiplier based on asset volatility
- Test different bandwidth expansion thresholds
- Consider adding RSI filter for overbought/oversold conditions

This strategy excels in trending markets with increasing volatility, while automatically exiting when volatility contracts. The combination of volume-weighted pricing and dual volatility indicators creates a robust framework for momentum trading.
