STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeRSI

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. This strategy combines mean-reversion principles with volatility analysis
2. Focuses on identifying extreme oversold conditions during low volatility periods
3. Capitalizes on the expansion following volatility contractions

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 3-day RSI must be below 20 (indicating extreme oversold)
2. Secondary Condition: 50-day historical volatility must be below its 10th percentile (showing compressed volatility)
3. Both conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit when price moves 1 standard deviation (based on 50-day volatility) from entry point
2. Consider adding a time-based exit (e.g., 5 days) if price doesn't reach target
3. Optional: Exit if 3-day RSI crosses above 50 (momentum shift)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should account for the expected volatility expansion
2. Recommended stop-loss at 0.5 standard deviation below entry
3. Maximum risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of capital
4. Avoid trading during major news events that may distort volatility

Required Indicators:
1. 3-day RSI (Relative Strength Index)
2. 50-day historical volatility (standard deviation of price changes)
3. 10th percentile volatility threshold (requires historical calculation)
4. Standard deviation bands for exit targets

Additional Notes:
1. Works best in range-bound markets with periodic volatility expansions
2. Most effective on liquid assets with consistent volatility patterns
3. Requires regular recalibration of volatility percentiles
4. Consider filtering for assets with mean-reverting tendencies
5. Backtest suggested for optimal parameter tuning

Implementation Tips:
1. Calculate the 10th percentile volatility using rolling 50-day lookback
2. Standard deviation move should be based on recent volatility
3. Consider using closing prices for consistency
4. May work better on daily timeframe than intraday
