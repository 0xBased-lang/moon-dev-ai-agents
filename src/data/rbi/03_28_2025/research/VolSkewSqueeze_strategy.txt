STRATEGY_NAME: VolSkewSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
The **VolSkewSqueeze** strategy combines Bollinger Band squeeze detection with volume skew analysis to identify high-probability breakout trades. It focuses on periods of low volatility (squeeze) followed by directional moves confirmed by increasing volume in the breakout direction.  

### **Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze**  
   - Uses standard Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations)  
   - Squeeze occurs when the distance between upper and lower bands reaches a 6-month low percentile (threshold adjustable)  

2. **Volume Skew Confirmation**  
   - Compares current volume to 20-period average volume  
   - Requires volume to be at least 1.5x the average in the breakout direction  
   - Volume must be skewed toward buying (long) or selling (short) pressure  

3. **Volatility-Based Exit**  
   - Trailing stop based on recent ATR (14-period)  
   - Exit if price reverses into opposite squeeze or hits trailing stop  

### **Entry Rules:**  
**Long Entry:**  
- Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band  
- Volume exceeds 1.5x 20-period average  
- No opposing squeeze condition (bands not contracting again)  

**Short Entry:**  
- Price breaks below lower Bollinger Band  
- Volume exceeds 1.5x 20-period average  
- No opposing squeeze condition  

### **Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** 2x ATR(14) from recent peak/trough  
- **Early Exit:** If Bollinger Bands re-enter squeeze state (contraction)  
- **Time-Based Exit:** Close trade after 5 bars if no follow-through  

### **Risk Management:**  
- Position size: 1-2% of capital per trade  
- Stop-loss: Initial stop at 1x ATR(14) from entry  
- Max daily trades: 3 (to avoid overexposure)  

### **Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20, 2)  
2. Volume (20-period average)  
3. ATR (14-period)  

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using volume as a key filter to avoid false breakouts. The name **VolSkewSqueeze** reflects its unique blend of volatility contraction (squeeze) and volume skew confirmation.
