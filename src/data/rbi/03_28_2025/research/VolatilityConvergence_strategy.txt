STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityConvergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated intraday pairs trading strategy that capitalizes on mean-reverting behavior between cointegrated volatility ETFs, using VIX correlation dynamics and volume-confirmed momentum signals.

Key Components:
1. Cointegrated ETF Pair Selection: Focuses on volatility ETFs with proven mean-reverting characteristics (e.g., VXX/UVXY or other VIX-linked products)
2. VIX Correlation Framework: Uses rolling correlation to the VIX as the foundation for spread calculation
3. Bollinger Band Trigger: Enters when spread exceeds Bollinger Bands (typically 2 standard deviations) of the VIX-correlated spread
4. Volume-Confirmed Momentum: Requires supporting volume patterns for exit signals

Entry Rules:
1. Calculate the normalized spread between the selected ETFs based on their rolling VIX correlation
2. When spread exceeds upper/lower Bollinger Band (2 std dev) of its 20-period moving average
3. Confirm with volume ratio between the pair showing divergence (higher volume in the underperforming leg)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When spread returns to its 20-period moving average
2. Secondary Exit: If momentum diverges (RSI crosses 50) with confirming volume patterns
3. Emergency Exit: If spread exceeds 3 std dev from mean (risk control)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on spread volatility (ATR of spread)
2. Maximum risk per trade: 1% of capital
3. Stop-loss at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width
4. Daily loss limit: 5% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. Rolling VIX correlation (20-period)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) on normalized spread
3. Volume ratio oscillator
4. RSI (14-period) for momentum confirmation
5. Average True Range of spread for sizing

Optimization Notes:
- Best performance during high VIX regimes (>20)
- Requires liquid ETF pairs with tight bid-ask spreads
- Most effective between 10am-2pm ET when volatility markets are most active

This strategy combines statistical arbitrage principles with volatility market dynamics, creating a unique approach to ETF pairs trading that differs from traditional mean-reversion strategies through its VIX-correlation foundation and volume-confirmed exits.
