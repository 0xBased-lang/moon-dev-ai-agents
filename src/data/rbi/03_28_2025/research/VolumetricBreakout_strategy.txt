STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines volatility breakout (Bollinger Bands) with volume confirmation
- Uses RSI for exit timing
- Requires simultaneous confirmation from price action and volume
- Designed to capture strong momentum moves with volume validation

2. Entry Rules:
- Price must close ABOVE the upper Bollinger Band (20 period, 2 std dev)
- Current volume must exceed the 90th percentile of recent volume (suggested lookback: 20-50 periods)
- Both conditions must occur on the same candle
- Only long positions are taken (no short side)

3. Exit Rules:
- Close position when RSI(14) crosses BELOW 70
- Optional secondary exit: If price closes back inside Bollinger Bands before RSI exit triggers
- No trailing stop required (RSI acts as momentum filter)

4. Risk Management:
- Recommended stop loss: Recent swing low or 1-2% below entry
- Position sizing based on volatility (ATR-based sizing recommended)
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20 period, 2 standard deviations)
- Volume indicator with percentile calculation (90th percentile threshold)
- RSI (14 period)
- Optional: ATR for position sizing

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- Works well in trending markets, may produce false signals in ranging conditions
- Suggested timeframe: 1-hour charts or higher for reliability
- Volume percentile should be calculated dynamically based on recent market conditions
- Consider filtering trades with overall market direction (e.g., only trade long when above 200MA)
