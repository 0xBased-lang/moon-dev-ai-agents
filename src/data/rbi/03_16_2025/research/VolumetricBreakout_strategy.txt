STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricBreakout strategy focuses on identifying high-probability breakout opportunities by combining engulfing candlestick patterns with significant volume spikes. This approach capitalizes on periods of heightened market activity and volatility, aiming to catch strong directional moves.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Engulfing Candlestick Pattern: Look for bullish or bearish engulfing patterns that signal potential trend reversals or continuations.
2. Volume Analysis: Identify significant volume spikes that confirm the strength of the engulfing pattern.
3. Volatility Filter: Use ATR (Average True Range) to ensure the market is sufficiently volatile for breakout trades.
4. Confirmation: Wait for price to break above/below key levels (e.g., recent highs/lows) to confirm the breakout.

Entry Rules:
1. Bullish Setup:
   - Bullish engulfing pattern forms
   - Volume during the engulfing candle is at least 2x the 20-period average
   - ATR(14) is above its 20-period moving average
   - Enter long when price breaks above the high of the engulfing candle

2. Bearish Setup:
   - Bearish engulfing pattern forms
   - Volume during the engulfing candle is at least 2x the 20-period average
   - ATR(14) is above its 20-period moving average
   - Enter short when price breaks below the low of the engulfing candle

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit:
   - Set TP at 1.5x ATR(14) from entry point
   - Alternatively, trail stop using 50% of ATR(14)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place stop loss at the opposite side of the engulfing candle
   - Maximum risk should not exceed 1% of account equity

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 3%
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Only trade during high-volume market hours

Required Indicators:
1. Volume (standard volume indicator)
2. ATR(14) - Average True Range
3. Moving Average of Volume (20-period)
4. Moving Average of ATR (20-period)

Additional Notes:
- Focus on liquid markets with tight spreads
- Best applied to 1-hour or 4-hour charts
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups
- Monitor for false breakouts by waiting for candle close beyond key levels

This strategy works best in trending markets and should be avoided during choppy or range-bound conditions. Always backtest and forward test before live trading.
