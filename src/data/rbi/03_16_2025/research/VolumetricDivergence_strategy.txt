STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricDivergence strategy is a volatility-based approach that identifies trading opportunities by analyzing the intersection of price action and volume patterns. The strategy focuses on divergence points between price and volume, using their distance as a trigger for trades. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Price Action Analysis**: Monitor price movements to identify trends, support/resistance levels, and key price levels.
2. **Volume Patterns**: Analyze volume data to detect unusual activity, such as spikes or sustained increases, which may indicate potential reversals or continuations.
3. **Divergence Detection**: Identify divergence points where price and volume move in opposite directions, signaling potential market reversals or continuations.
4. **Volatility Measurement**: Use volatility indicators to assess market conditions and adjust trade parameters accordingly.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Entry**: 
   - Price is in an uptrend (higher highs and higher lows).
   - Volume shows a significant increase, confirming the price movement.
   - A divergence point is identified where price continues to rise while volume decreases.
   - Enter a long position when the distance between the divergence points reaches a predefined threshold.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - Price is in a downtrend (lower highs and lower lows).
   - Volume shows a significant increase, confirming the price movement.
   - A divergence point is identified where price continues to fall while volume decreases.
   - Enter a short position when the distance between the divergence points reaches a predefined threshold.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**: 
   - Set a take profit level based on a multiple of the average true range (ATR) or a fixed percentage of the entry price.
   - Alternatively, exit when a new divergence point is detected in the opposite direction.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss below the recent swing low for long positions or above the recent swing high for short positions.
   - Adjust the stop loss based on volatility, using a percentage of the ATR.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of the account balance for each trade (e.g., 1-2%).
2. **Volatility Adjustment**: Increase position size in low volatility conditions and decrease it in high volatility conditions.
3. **Diversification**: Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or market by spreading trades across different instruments.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Volume Indicator**: To analyze volume patterns and detect divergence points.
2. **Average True Range (ATR)**: To measure volatility and set stop loss/take profit levels.
3. **Moving Averages**: To identify trends and confirm price action.
4. **Divergence Detector**: A custom indicator or script to identify divergence points between price and volume.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Backtesting**: Thoroughly backtest the strategy on historical data to validate its effectiveness.
- **Market Conditions**: The strategy may perform better in trending markets with clear price and volume patterns.
- **Timeframes**: Suitable for various timeframes, but may require adjustments for shorter or longer periods.

By focusing on the intersection of price action and volume patterns, the VolumetricDivergence strategy aims to capitalize on market inefficiencies and provide high-probability trading opportunities.
