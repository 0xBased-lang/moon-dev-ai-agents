STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentPulse strategy is a momentum-based approach that combines RSI and MACD divergence signals with volume confirmation and Bollinger Bands for exit management. It focuses on identifying strong upward momentum shifts in oversold conditions.

Key Components:
1. RSI (14-period) for oversold identification (below 30)
2. MACD (12,26,9) for bullish divergence confirmation
3. Volume indicator for confirmation of increasing buying pressure
4. Bollinger Bands (20,2) for exit signals

Entry Rules:
1. RSI must be below 30 (oversold condition)
2. MACD must show bullish divergence (price making lower lows while MACD makes higher lows)
3. Volume must be increasing compared to previous 5 candles
4. All conditions must align on the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit: Price touches the upper Bollinger Band
2. Secondary exit: 2% profit target is reached (whichever comes first)
3. Emergency exit: If RSI crosses back below 30 after entry

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1% of capital per trade
2. Stop-loss: Set at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) below entry price
3. Maximum daily trades: 3 to prevent overtrading
4. Time filter: Only trade during high-volume hours (first 2 hours of market open)

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14-period)
2. MACD (12,26,9)
3. Volume indicator
4. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
5. ATR (14-period) for stop-loss calculation
