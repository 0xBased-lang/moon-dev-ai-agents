STRATEGY_NAME: ATRMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ATRMomentum strategy is a momentum-based approach designed to identify underbought stocks by leveraging the inverse relationship between short-term price movement and volatility. The strategy uses the 5-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Average True Range (ATR) to pinpoint potential entry points when stocks show signs of oversold conditions combined with decreasing volatility.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **5-Day RSI**: Measures short-term momentum to identify oversold conditions (typically below 30).
2. **Average True Range (ATR)**: Tracks volatility and helps identify when volatility is contracting relative to historical highs.
3. **Historical ATR Highs**: Used as a benchmark to determine when the current ATR has dropped significantly (1% below historical highs).

### Entry Rules:
1. **Condition 1**: The 5-day RSI must be below 30, indicating the stock is oversold.
2. **Condition 2**: The current ATR must drop by at least 1% relative to its historical high (calculated over a predefined lookback period, e.g., 20 days).
3. **Entry Signal**: When both conditions are met, enter a long position.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**: Set a profit target based on a percentage gain (e.g., 5% or 10%) or use a trailing stop to capture momentum.
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss at a predefined level below the entry price (e.g., 2% or 3%) to manage downside risk.
3. **RSI Exit**: Exit the position if the 5-day RSI rises above 70, indicating overbought conditions.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Allocate a fixed percentage of the portfolio to each trade (e.g., 1-2%) to limit exposure.
2. **Diversification**: Trade multiple stocks across different sectors to reduce concentration risk.
3. **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading during periods of extreme market volatility by monitoring broader market ATR or VIX levels.

### Required Indicators:
1. **5-Day RSI**: To identify oversold conditions.
2. **ATR (14-period)**: To measure volatility and identify contraction.
3. **Historical ATR Highs**: To determine the 1% drop threshold.

### Additional Notes:
- The strategy works best in trending or mildly volatile markets.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters (e.g., RSI threshold, ATR lookback period, and profit/stop levels).
- Combine with fundamental analysis to ensure the selected stocks have strong underlying fundamentals.

By focusing on the interplay between momentum and volatility, the ATRMomentum strategy aims to capture opportunities in underbought stocks while managing risk through disciplined entry and exit rules.
