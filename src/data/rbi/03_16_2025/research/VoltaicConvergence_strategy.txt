STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicConvergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicConvergence strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines volatility analysis with oscillator convergence to identify high-probability trading opportunities. It focuses on detecting moments when price approaches recent highs while volatility contracts, signaling potential breakouts or continuations.

Key Strategy Components:
1. ATR (Average True Range) - Measures market volatility
2. KST (Know Sure Thing) Oscillator - Momentum indicator
3. Recent Highs - Price levels for reference
4. Volatility Multiples - ATR-based thresholds for exits

Entry Rules:
1. Identify when price is within 1% of a recent high (last 20 candles)
2. Confirm that ATR (14-period) is below the corresponding KST value
3. Enter long position when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Set initial stop-loss at 1.5x ATR below entry price
2. Take profit when ATR reaches 2x its value at entry
3. Exit if price closes below the 20-period EMA

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1% of capital per trade
2. Use position sizing based on ATR at entry
3. Maintain a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio minimum

Required Indicators:
1. ATR (14-period)
2. KST Oscillator (default settings)
3. 20-period EMA
4. Recent Highs (20-period)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets
- Combine with fundamental analysis for better context
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Backtest thoroughly before live implementation

This strategy capitalizes on the convergence of price momentum and volatility contraction, providing a systematic approach to trading breakouts while managing risk effectively through volatility-based position sizing and exits.
