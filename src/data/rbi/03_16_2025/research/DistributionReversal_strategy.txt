STRATEGY_NAME: DistributionReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DistributionReversal strategy combines momentum and contrarian approaches by identifying in-distribution breakouts for long positions and out-of-distribution mean reversion setups for short positions. This strategy leverages statistical distribution analysis to determine optimal entry and exit points, balancing momentum continuation with mean reversion opportunities.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **In-Distribution Breakouts (Longs):**
   - Identify price levels within the normal distribution range (e.g., within 1 standard deviation of the mean).
   - Look for breakouts above resistance levels within this range, signaling strong momentum continuation.

2. **Out-of-Distribution Mean Reversion (Shorts):**
   - Identify price levels outside the normal distribution range (e.g., beyond 2 standard deviations from the mean).
   - Look for overextended price movements that are likely to revert to the mean.

3. **Statistical Distribution Analysis:**
   - Use Bollinger Bands or standard deviation channels to define in-distribution and out-of-distribution price levels.
   - Combine with volume analysis to confirm the strength of breakouts or reversals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry (In-Distribution Breakout):**
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or resistance level within the normal distribution range.
   - Volume must confirm the breakout (e.g., above-average volume).
   - RSI should be above 50 but not overbought (e.g., below 70).

2. **Short Entry (Out-of-Distribution Mean Reversion):**
   - Price moves beyond 2 standard deviations from the mean (e.g., above the upper Bollinger Band or below the lower band).
   - RSI is in overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) territory.
   - Volume shows signs of exhaustion (e.g., declining volume during the overextension).

---

### Exit Rules:
1. **Long Exit:**
   - Take profit when price reaches the next resistance level or the upper Bollinger Band.
   - Exit if RSI moves into overbought territory (above 70) or if price closes below the breakout level.

2. **Short Exit:**
   - Take profit when price reverts to the mean (e.g., middle Bollinger Band or moving average).
   - Exit if RSI moves out of overbought/oversold territory or if price breaks above/below the recent high/low.

---

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing:**
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop-loss level.

2. **Stop-Loss Placement:**
   - For longs, place the stop-loss below the breakout level or the lower Bollinger Band.
   - For shorts, place the stop-loss above the recent high or the upper Bollinger Band.

3. **Risk-Reward Ratio:**
   - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 for both long and short trades.

---

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations):**
   - Defines in-distribution and out-of-distribution price levels.

2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period):**
   - Identifies overbought/oversold conditions and confirms momentum strength.

3. **Volume Indicator:**
   - Confirms breakout strength or exhaustion during overextensions.

4. **Moving Average (50-period):**
   - Acts as a dynamic support/resistance level and mean reversion target.
