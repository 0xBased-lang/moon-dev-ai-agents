STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityDivergence strategy is a short-selling approach that combines MACD divergence analysis with volatility spikes to identify high-probability bearish setups. The strategy focuses on capitalizing on bearish momentum during periods of heightened market uncertainty.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **MACD Divergence**: Identifies bearish momentum when price makes higher highs while MACD makes lower highs.
2. **VIX Volatility Spike**: Uses the VIX (Volatility Index) to confirm market fear and potential downside acceleration.
3. **Implied Volatility and Volume**: Monitors these factors for exit signals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bearish MACD Divergence**: 
   - Price makes a higher high, but the MACD histogram or line makes a lower high.
   - This indicates weakening bullish momentum and potential reversal.
2. **VIX Spike**:
   - VIX must show a significant spike (e.g., >10% increase from its recent average).
   - This confirms increased market fear and potential for downside momentum.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Rising Implied Volatility**:
   - If implied volatility (IV) begins to rise sharply after the trade is initiated, consider exiting.
   - Rising IV can indicate uncertainty or a potential reversal.
2. **Volume Decline**:
   - If trading volume declines significantly (e.g., >30% drop from entry volume), exit the trade.
   - Low volume suggests weakening momentum and reduced follow-through.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss above the recent swing high or a predefined percentage (e.g., 2-3% above entry).
2. **Position Sizing**:
   - Use conservative position sizing to account for the high volatility environment.
   - Allocate no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.
3. **Time-Based Exit**:
   - If the trade does not move in your favor within 2-3 days, consider exiting to avoid prolonged exposure.

### Required Indicators:
1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - Settings: Default (12, 26, 9) or customized based on the timeframe.
2. **VIX (Volatility Index)**:
   - Monitor for spikes and overall trend.
3. **Volume Indicator**:
   - Use on-chart volume to confirm entry and exit signals.
4. **Implied Volatility Data**:
   - Track IV levels for the underlying asset (if available).

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or volatile markets.
- Avoid using it during low-volatility or sideways market conditions.
- Combine with broader market analysis (e.g., S&P 500 trends) for higher accuracy.

By focusing on bearish divergence and volatility spikes, the VolatilityDivergence strategy aims to capture sharp downside moves while managing risk effectively in high-volatility environments.
