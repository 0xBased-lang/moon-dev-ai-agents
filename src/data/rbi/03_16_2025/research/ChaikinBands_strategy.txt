STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinBands

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ChaikinBands strategy combines the Chaikin Oscillator and Bollinger Bands to identify intraday breakout opportunities. This approach leverages the momentum insights from the Chaikin Oscillator and the volatility-based price boundaries from Bollinger Bands to create a robust trading system.

### Key Components:
1. **Chaikin Oscillator**: Measures the accumulation/distribution line's momentum, helping identify potential trend reversals or continuations.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: Provides dynamic support and resistance levels based on price volatility, helping identify breakout zones.
3. **Timeframe**: Optimized for intraday trading (e.g., 5-minute or 15-minute charts).

### Entry Rules:
1. **Breakout Confirmation**:
   - Wait for the price to break above the upper Bollinger Band (for a long entry) or below the lower Bollinger Band (for a short entry).
   - Ensure the Chaikin Oscillator is above the zero line for a long entry or below the zero line for a short entry, confirming bullish or bearish momentum.
2. **Volume Filter**:
   - Confirm the breakout with above-average trading volume to ensure the move has strong participation.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a take-profit level at the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2).
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss just below the breakout candle's low for long trades or above the breakout candle's high for short trades.
3. **Reversal Signal**:
   - Exit the trade if the Chaikin Oscillator crosses back below the zero line (for long trades) or above the zero line (for short trades).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. **Volatility Adjustment**:
   - Adjust position size based on the width of the Bollinger Bands (wider bands indicate higher volatility, requiring smaller position sizes).
3. **Time-Based Exit**:
   - Exit trades that do not reach the take-profit level within a predefined time window (e.g., 2-3 hours) to avoid holding losing positions.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Chaikin Oscillator**:
   - Parameters: Default settings (3-day EMA of the accumulation/distribution line minus a 10-day EMA of the same line).
2. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Parameters: 20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations.
3. **Volume Indicator**:
   - Use a simple volume histogram to confirm breakout strength.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or high-volatility markets. Avoid using it during low-volatility or sideways market conditions.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple instruments and timeframes to optimize parameters for your specific trading style.

By combining the momentum insights of the Chaikin Oscillator with the volatility-based boundaries of Bollinger Bands, the ChaikinBands strategy provides a systematic approach to intraday breakout trading.
