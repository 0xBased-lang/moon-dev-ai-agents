STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityEdge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityEdge strategy capitalizes on the extremes of implied volatility by exploiting the divergence between high and low volatility environments. This approach combines options trading with volatility analysis to create a delta-neutral position that profits from volatility mean reversion.

Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volatility Analysis**: Focus on the VIX index as the primary volatility indicator
2. **Options Selection**: Use call and put options to create a delta-neutral position
3. **Volatility Extremes**: Identify specific VIX thresholds for trade execution
4. **Risk Management**: Implement trailing stop-loss at original strike price

Entry Rules:
1. **High Volatility Entry (Long Call)**
   - Wait for VIX > 50
   - Buy at-the-money (ATM) or slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) call options
   - Ensure position is delta-neutral by adjusting with underlying asset or other options

2. **Low Volatility Entry (Short Put)**
   - Wait for VIX < 20
   - Sell at-the-money (ATM) or slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) put options
   - Maintain delta-neutral position through hedging

Exit Rules:
1. **Trailing Stop-Loss**
   - Set stop-loss at original strike price for both positions
   - Adjust stop-loss as price moves in favorable direction

2. **Volatility Mean Reversion**
   - Close long call position when VIX drops below 40
   - Close short put position when VIX rises above 25

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk tolerance (1-2% per trade)
2. Use of delta-neutral hedging to minimize directional risk
3. Regular monitoring of implied volatility changes
4. Strict adherence to stop-loss levels

Required Indicators:
1. VIX Index (Implied Volatility)
2. Options Greeks (Delta, Vega, Theta)
3. Price charts with strike price levels
4. Volatility cones or historical volatility bands

Additional Considerations:
- Monitor earnings announcements and macroeconomic events that could impact volatility
- Adjust position sizes based on volatility skew and term structure
- Consider using volatility ETFs or futures for hedging purposes
- Regularly review and adjust delta-neutral positions as market conditions change

This strategy requires a solid understanding of options pricing and volatility dynamics, making it suitable for intermediate to advanced traders with access to real-time volatility data and options trading platforms.
