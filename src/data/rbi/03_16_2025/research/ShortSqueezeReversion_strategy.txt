STRATEGY_NAME: ShortSqueezeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ShortSqueezeReversion strategy is a value-based momentum approach that focuses on identifying stocks with high short interest relative to their trading volume, aiming to capitalize on potential short squeezes and RSI mean-reversion opportunities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **High Short Interest Relative to Volume**: 
   - Focus on stocks with a high short interest ratio (short interest / average daily volume). This indicates a higher likelihood of a short squeeze if the stock begins to rise.
   - Example: A short interest ratio above 20% is considered high.

2. **1-Day RSI Mean-Reversion Threshold**:
   - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a 1-day timeframe to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
   - Target stocks with an RSI below 30 (oversold) for long entries, anticipating a mean-reversion bounce.

3. **Momentum Confirmation**:
   - Ensure the stock is showing signs of upward momentum (e.g., recent price increase or volume spike) to confirm the potential for a short squeeze.

### **Entry Rules**
1. **Stock Selection**:
   - Screen for stocks with a short interest ratio above 20%.
   - Ensure the stock is liquid enough to trade (e.g., average daily volume > 1 million shares).

2. **RSI Condition**:
   - Enter a long position when the 1-day RSI drops below 30, indicating oversold conditions.

3. **Momentum Confirmation**:
   - Confirm entry if the stock price has shown a recent upward movement (e.g., 3 consecutive green candles) or a spike in volume.

---

### **Exit Rules**
1. **Profit Target**:
   - Set a profit target based on the stock's average true range (ATR) or a fixed percentage gain (e.g., 5-10%).
   - Alternatively, exit when the 1-day RSI reaches 70 (overbought), signaling a potential reversal.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss below the recent swing low or at a fixed percentage loss (e.g., 3-5%) to manage risk.

3. **Time-Based Exit**:
   - Exit the trade if the expected short squeeze or momentum does not materialize within 1-2 days.

---

### **Risk Management**
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Allocate a small percentage of the portfolio (e.g., 1-2%) to each trade to limit exposure to any single position.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Trade multiple stocks simultaneously to spread risk across different sectors and avoid overconcentration.

3. **Stop Loss Discipline**:
   - Strictly adhere to stop-loss levels to prevent large drawdowns.

### **Required Indicators**
1. **Short Interest Ratio**:
   - Calculate as (Short Interest / Average Daily Volume). Use this to identify high short interest stocks.

2. **1-Day RSI**:
   - Use the Relative Strength Index on a 1-day timeframe to identify oversold conditions (RSI < 30).

3. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Monitor trading volume for spikes or unusual activity, which can signal the start of a short squeeze.

4. **ATR (Optional)**:
   - Use the Average True Range to set profit targets or stop-loss levels based on volatility.

### **Example Trade Setup**
1. **Stock**: XYZ has a short interest ratio of 25% and an average daily volume of 2 million shares.
2. **RSI**: The 1-day RSI drops to 28, indicating oversold conditions.
3. **Momentum**: XYZ shows 3 consecutive green candles with increasing volume.
4. **Entry**: Enter a long position at $50.
5. **Exit**: Set a profit target at $55 (10% gain) or exit if RSI reaches 70. Place a stop loss at $47.50 (5% loss).

This strategy combines value (high short interest) with momentum (RSI mean-reversion) to identify high-probability short squeeze opportunities while managing risk through disciplined position sizing and stop-loss rules.
