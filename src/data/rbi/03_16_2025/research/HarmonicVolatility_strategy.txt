STRATEGY_NAME: HarmonicVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The HarmonicVolatility strategy is designed to identify trading opportunities using Harmonic Volatility Bands, which are a unique combination of harmonic patterns and volatility-based bands. This strategy focuses on capturing price movements within defined volatility ranges while leveraging harmonic patterns for precise entry and exit points.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Harmonic Volatility Bands**: These bands are created by combining harmonic price patterns with volatility measurements. The bands adjust dynamically based on market volatility, providing a clear range for potential price movements.
2. **Harmonic Patterns**: Specific price patterns (e.g., Gartley, Butterfly, Crab) are used to identify potential reversal zones within the volatility bands.
3. **Volatility Measurement**: A volatility indicator (e.g., ATR or Bollinger Bands) is used to define the width of the bands, ensuring they adapt to changing market conditions.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Pattern Confirmation**: Wait for a harmonic pattern (e.g., Gartley or Butterfly) to form within the Harmonic Volatility Bands.
2. **Price Rejection**: Look for price rejection (e.g., wicks or pin bars) at the completion point of the harmonic pattern within the bands.
3. **Volatility Confirmation**: Ensure the volatility bands are not excessively wide, indicating stable market conditions.
4. **Entry Signal**: Enter a trade when the price confirms the harmonic pattern and shows a reversal signal (e.g., bullish/bearish engulfing or divergence).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Target Levels**: Set profit targets at the next harmonic level or a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss just outside the Harmonic Volatility Band or below/above the recent swing high/low.
3. **Volatility Exit**: Exit the trade if the volatility bands expand significantly, indicating increased market uncertainty.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your trading capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 to ensure profitable trades outweigh losses.
3. **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading during periods of extreme volatility (e.g., news events) when the bands may become unreliable.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Harmonic Pattern Scanner**: A tool or indicator to identify harmonic patterns (e.g., Gartley, Butterfly, Crab).
2. **Volatility Bands**: Custom bands based on ATR or Bollinger Bands to define the Harmonic Volatility Bands.
3. **Price Action Tools**: Candlestick patterns (e.g., pin bars, engulfing) or divergence indicators for confirmation signals.

The HarmonicVolatility strategy is ideal for traders who want to combine the precision of harmonic patterns with the adaptability of volatility-based bands, providing a structured approach to trading in dynamic market conditions.
