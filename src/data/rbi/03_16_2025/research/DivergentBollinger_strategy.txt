STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentBollinger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentBollinger strategy is a trend-following approach that focuses on identifying bearish divergence signals combined with Bollinger Band and volume analysis. The strategy is designed to capture short-term downward trends while incorporating confirmation signals from RSI and ATR for exit conditions.

Key Strategy Components:
1. MACD Bearish Divergence: The strategy looks for bearish divergence between the MACD line and price action, indicating weakening momentum.
2. Bollinger Band Positioning: Requires price to be below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting oversold conditions.
3. Volume Analysis: Decreasing volume during the bearish divergence confirms weakening buying pressure.
4. RSI Confirmation: Used as an exit signal when it confirms the divergence.
5. ATR Breakeven: Acts as a secondary exit condition based on volatility.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for MACD to show bearish divergence (price making higher highs while MACD makes lower highs).
2. Confirm price is below the lower Bollinger Band.
3. Verify that volume is decreasing during the divergence period.
4. Enter a short position when all three conditions are met.

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Close the position when RSI confirms the divergence (typically when RSI shows oversold conditions or begins to reverse).
2. Secondary Exit: Use ATR to set a breakeven stop-loss. If the price moves against the position by more than the ATR value, exit the trade.

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on account risk tolerance (typically 1-2% of total capital per trade).
2. Use ATR to determine stop-loss levels, placing it at 1.5x ATR above the entry price.
3. Avoid trading during high-impact news events or low liquidity periods.

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12,26,9) - For identifying bearish divergence.
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - For identifying oversold conditions.
3. Volume Indicator - For confirming decreasing volume.
4. RSI (14) - For divergence confirmation and exit signals.
5. ATR (14) - For setting breakeven stop-loss levels.

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals in ranging conditions.
- Backtest the strategy on your specific market and timeframe before live trading.
- Consider combining with fundamental analysis for better context in longer timeframes.
