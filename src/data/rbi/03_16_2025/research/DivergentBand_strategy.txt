STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentBand

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentBand strategy combines MACD divergence analysis with Bollinger Bands and ATR-based profit targets to identify high-probability trading opportunities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. Key Components:
- MACD (12,26,9) for divergence detection
- Bollinger Bands (14-period, 2 standard deviations)
- ATR (14-period) for profit target calculation

2. Entry Rules:
- Look for MACD divergence (price makes higher high while MACD makes lower high, or vice versa)
- Confirm price is within Bollinger Bands (not breaking out)
- Wait for price to touch or approach the opposite band from the divergence direction
- Enter trade in the direction of the divergence when both conditions align

3. Exit Rules:
- Set profit target at 1.5x ATR from entry price
- Place stop loss at 0.75x ATR from entry price
- Exit immediately if price breaks through the opposite Bollinger Band

4. Risk Management:
- Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
- Use ATR-based position sizing to maintain consistent risk
- Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

5. Required Indicators:
- MACD (12,26,9)
- Bollinger Bands (14,2)
- ATR (14)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best applied on 1-hour or 4-hour charts for optimal results
- Works well in ranging or mildly trending markets
- Avoid using in strongly trending markets where price may break through bands
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation

This strategy aims to capture mean-reversion moves within established ranges while using MACD divergence as a leading indicator of potential reversals. The ATR-based profit targets and stop losses help maintain a favorable risk-reward ratio while adapting to current market volatility.
