STRATEGY_NAME: FibroVolume

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroVolume strategy combines Fibonacci retracement levels with volume analysis and momentum indicators to identify high-probability pullback trades. The strategy focuses on price retracements to key Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) accompanied by reduced volume, signaling a potential reversal. Exits are determined using RSI divergence or MACD crossovers, ensuring timely profit-taking or stop-loss execution.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: Used to identify potential support/resistance zones during pullbacks.
2. **Volume Analysis**: Reduced volume at Fibonacci levels indicates weakening momentum and potential reversal.
3. **RSI Divergence**: Detects momentum shifts for exit signals.
4. **MACD Crossover**: Confirms trend reversals for exit decisions.

### Entry Rules:
1. Identify a strong trend (uptrend or downtrend) using price action or a trend indicator (e.g., EMA).
2. Draw Fibonacci retracement levels from the recent swing high to swing low (for uptrends) or swing low to swing high (for downtrends).
3. Wait for price to retrace to a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%).
4. Confirm reduced volume at the retracement level compared to the previous trend's volume.
5. Enter a trade in the direction of the original trend:
   - **Long Entry**: In an uptrend, when price touches a Fibonacci level with reduced volume.
   - **Short Entry**: In a downtrend, when price touches a Fibonacci level with reduced volume.

### Exit Rules:
1. **RSI Divergence Exit**:
   - For long trades, exit when RSI shows bearish divergence (price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs).
   - For short trades, exit when RSI shows bullish divergence (price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows).
2. **MACD Crossover Exit**:
   - For long trades, exit when MACD line crosses below the signal line.
   - For short trades, exit when MACD line crosses above the signal line.
3. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
   - Place stop-loss slightly below the Fibonacci level for long trades or above the Fibonacci level for short trades.

### Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. Use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) based on the distance between entry and stop-loss levels.
3. Avoid trading during high-impact news events to prevent erratic price movements.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: To identify key retracement levels.
2. **Volume Indicator**: To confirm reduced volume at Fibonacci levels.
3. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: To detect divergence for exit signals.
4. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: To confirm trend reversals for exits.

### Example Setup:
- **Uptrend Scenario**:
  - Price retraces to the 50% Fibonacci level.
  - Volume decreases significantly compared to the previous uptrend.
  - Enter a long trade with a stop-loss below the 61.8% level.
  - Exit when RSI shows bearish divergence or MACD crosses below the signal line.

- **Downtrend Scenario**:
  - Price retraces to the 38.2% Fibonacci level.
  - Volume decreases significantly compared to the previous downtrend.
  - Enter a short trade with a stop-loss above the 38.2% level.
  - Exit when RSI shows bullish divergence or MACD crosses above the signal line.

This strategy is ideal for traders who prefer combining technical levels with volume and momentum analysis to capture high-probability reversals in trending markets.
