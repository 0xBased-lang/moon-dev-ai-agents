STRATEGY_NAME: FractalConvergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalConvergence strategy is a unique approach that combines price fractal analysis with the convergence of both bullish and bearish Williams %D (W.D.) indicators. This strategy aims to identify high-probability entry points by aligning fractal patterns with momentum confirmation from the Williams %D oscillator.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Price Fractals**: 
   - Fractals are used to identify potential reversal points in the market. A bullish fractal is a pattern of five consecutive bars where the middle bar has the highest high, while a bearish fractal has the middle bar with the lowest low.
   
2. **Williams %D (W.D.)**:
   - Williams %D is a momentum oscillator that measures overbought and oversold conditions. It is derived from Williams %R and smoothed to provide clearer signals.
   - Bullish W.D. convergence occurs when the price is in a downtrend, but W.D. starts to rise, indicating potential upward momentum.
   - Bearish W.D. convergence occurs when the price is in an uptrend, but W.D. starts to fall, indicating potential downward momentum.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - A bullish fractal forms (five-bar pattern with the middle bar having the highest high).
   - Williams %D shows bullish convergence (price is in a downtrend, but W.D. starts rising).
   - Enter a long position when both conditions are met.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - A bearish fractal forms (five-bar pattern with the middle bar having the lowest low).
   - Williams %D shows bearish convergence (price is in an uptrend, but W.D. starts falling).
   - Enter a short position when both conditions are met.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) based on the stop-loss distance.
   - Alternatively, exit when a new opposing fractal forms (e.g., a bearish fractal for a long position).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop-loss below the recent swing low for long positions or above the recent swing high for short positions.
   - Alternatively, use a percentage-based stop-loss (e.g., 1-2% of the entry price).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop-loss level.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or market. Spread trades across multiple instruments to reduce risk.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fractal Indicator**:
   - Used to identify bullish and bearish fractal patterns.

2. **Williams %D (W.D.)**:
   - Used to confirm momentum convergence with price fractals.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or ranging markets with clear fractal patterns.
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events or low-liquidity periods to reduce false signals.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters and confirm its effectiveness in your chosen market.

By combining fractal patterns with Williams %D convergence, the FractalConvergence strategy provides a robust framework for identifying high-probability trade setups while managing risk effectively.
