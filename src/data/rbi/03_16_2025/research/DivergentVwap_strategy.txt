STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentVwap

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentVwap strategy combines Stochastic Oscillator (SO), Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify high-probability long entries during oversold conditions with confirmation from volume-weighted price action. The strategy focuses on divergence patterns and uses RSI as an exit signal.

Key Components:
1. Stochastic Oscillator (SO): Identifies oversold conditions (below 20) and divergence from price action.
2. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): Confirms the trend direction with volume-weighted price movement.
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Used as an exit signal when approaching 30.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Stochastic Oscillator (SO) to drop below 20, indicating oversold conditions.
2. Confirm divergence between price action and SO (price making lower lows while SO makes higher lows).
3. Ensure VWAP is moving upward, confirming bullish momentum with volume support.
4. Enter a long position when all conditions align.

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor RSI as the trade progresses.
2. Close the position when RSI approaches 30, indicating potential overbought conditions or weakening momentum.

Risk Management:
1. Set a stop-loss below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) to limit downside risk.
2. Use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.
3. Avoid over-leveraging; maintain a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2.

Required Indicators:
1. Stochastic Oscillator (SO): Default settings (14,3,3).
2. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): Standard calculation.
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Default setting (14).
4. Price chart for divergence analysis.

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or range-bound markets.
- Avoid using it during high volatility or news events, as false signals may occur.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters and confirm its effectiveness in your chosen market.
