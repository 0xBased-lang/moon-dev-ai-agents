STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityAnchor

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityAnchor strategy combines volatility analysis with key support and resistance levels to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This approach is designed to capitalize on market reversals and breakouts while managing risk effectively.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Use ATR (Average True Range) to gauge market volatility
2. Support/Resistance Levels: Identify key price levels using recent swing highs/lows
3. Price Action Confirmation: Wait for clear candlestick patterns at key levels

Required Indicators:
- ATR (14-period)
- Horizontal support/resistance levels
- Candlestick patterns (engulfing, pin bars, etc.)

Entry Rules:
1. For Breakouts:
   - Wait for price to close above resistance or below support
   - ATR should be above its 20-period average (indicating sufficient volatility)
   - Enter on retest of broken level with confirmation candle

2. For Reversals:
   - Identify key support/resistance levels
   - Wait for price to reach these levels with ATR showing decreasing volatility
   - Look for reversal candlestick patterns (engulfing, pin bars, etc.)
   - Enter on confirmation of reversal pattern

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit:
   - For breakouts: Set target at next significant support/resistance level
   - For reversals: Set target at previous swing high/low

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place stop loss below support (for long trades) or above resistance (for short trades)
   - Adjust stop loss size based on current ATR value (1.5x ATR recommended)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
   - Adjust position size based on stop loss distance

2. Trade Filtering:
   - Only take trades when ATR is above its 20-period average for breakouts
   - Look for decreasing ATR for reversal setups
   - Avoid trading during major news events

3. Timeframe Considerations:
   - Works best on 1-hour and 4-hour charts
   - Can be adapted to daily charts for swing trading

Additional Notes:
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups
- Pay attention to volume spikes at key levels
- Use multiple time frame analysis to confirm setups
- Keep a trading journal to track performance and refine strategy parameters

This strategy is particularly effective in ranging markets with clear support/resistance levels and can be adapted to various asset classes including forex, stocks, and commodities.
