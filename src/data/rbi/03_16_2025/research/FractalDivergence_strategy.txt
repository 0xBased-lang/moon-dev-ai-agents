STRATEGY_NAME: FractalDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalDivergence strategy is a sophisticated trend-following approach that combines RSI divergence, fractal dimension analysis, and volume filtering to identify high-probability trade setups. The strategy focuses on aligning multiple technical indicators to confirm trend strength and potential reversals.

Key Components:
1. RSI Divergence: Identifies potential trend reversals by comparing price action with RSI momentum.
2. Fractal Dimension: Measures the complexity of price action to confirm trend strength.
3. Volume Filter: Uses decreasing volume as a confirmation signal for trend continuation.
4. ATR Multiples: Determines dynamic exit points based on market volatility.
5. Fibonacci Retracement: Provides additional exit levels based on key price levels.

Entry Rules:
1. Look for RSI divergence (bullish or bearish) on the daily chart.
2. Confirm increasing fractal dimension of price action using a fractal dimension indicator.
3. Ensure volume is decreasing during the divergence period.
4. Enter a long position on bullish divergence or a short position on bearish divergence when all conditions align.

Exit Rules:
1. Use ATR multiples (e.g., 2x ATR) as initial profit targets.
2. Set secondary exit points at key Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).
3. Implement a trailing stop based on ATR to lock in profits during strong trends.
4. Exit the trade if the fractal dimension starts decreasing, indicating potential trend weakness.

Risk Management:
1. Set stop-loss orders at 1x ATR below/above the entry point.
2. Risk no more than 1-2% of account equity per trade.
3. Use position sizing based on ATR to maintain consistent risk levels.
4. Avoid trading during high-impact news events or periods of extreme volatility.

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14-period) for divergence analysis.
2. Fractal Dimension Indicator (custom or built-in).
3. Volume Indicator (standard or OBV).
4. ATR (14-period) for volatility measurement.
5. Fibonacci Retracement Tool.

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best on daily and 4-hour timeframes for swing trading.
- Backtest thoroughly on different market conditions to optimize parameters.
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups.
- Monitor multiple timeframes for confirmation of fractal dimension trends.
