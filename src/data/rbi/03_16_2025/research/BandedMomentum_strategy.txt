STRATEGY_NAME: BandedMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandedMomentum strategy combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands to identify high-probability momentum-based trading opportunities. This strategy focuses on capturing strong trending moves by leveraging overbought/oversold conditions and volatility-based price breakouts.

### Key Components:
1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, typically set to a 14-period default.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: A volatility indicator consisting of a middle band (20-period SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations above and below the middle band, typically set to 2).

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - RSI crosses above the upper Bollinger Band (indicating strong momentum).
   - Price breaks above the middle Bollinger Band (confirming upward momentum).
   - Both conditions must occur simultaneously or within a short time frame (e.g., within the same candle or the next candle).

2. **Short Entry** (optional, if trading both directions):
   - RSI crosses below the lower Bollinger Band (indicating strong downward momentum).
   - Price breaks below the middle Bollinger Band (confirming downward momentum).
   - Both conditions must occur simultaneously or within a short time frame.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
   - Alternatively, exit when the RSI crosses back below the middle Bollinger Band (for long trades) or above the middle Bollinger Band (for short trades).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss below the most recent swing low (for long trades) or above the most recent swing high (for short trades).
   - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or ATR-based stop loss.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss levels.

2. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Only trade in the direction of the prevailing trend (use a higher timeframe trend filter, such as a 50-period SMA).
   - Avoid trading during low volatility periods (e.g., when Bollinger Bands are too narrow).

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (14-period default)**.
2. **Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations)**.
3. **Optional Trend Filter (e.g., 50-period SMA)**.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals in ranging or choppy conditions.
- Backtest thoroughly to optimize parameters (e.g., RSI period, Bollinger Band settings) for your specific market and timeframe.
- Combine with other confirmation tools (e.g., volume analysis, candlestick patterns) to increase accuracy.
