STRATEGY_NAME: StochasticBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The StochasticBreakout strategy combines the Stochastic Oscillator with breakout confirmation to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy focuses on detecting price breakouts while ensuring momentum alignment using the Stochastic Oscillator.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** - Used to identify overbought/oversold conditions and momentum direction.
2. **Price Breakout Levels** - Key support/resistance levels or recent swing highs/lows.
3. **Breakout Confirmation** - Requires a close above/below the breakout level with strong momentum.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Price breaks above a key resistance level.
   - Stochastic Oscillator is above 50 (indicating bullish momentum).
   - Wait for a candle to close above the breakout level for confirmation.
2. **Short Entry**:
   - Price breaks below a key support level.
   - Stochastic Oscillator is below 50 (indicating bearish momentum).
   - Wait for a candle to close below the breakout level for confirmation.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).
   - Alternatively, use the next significant support/resistance level as a target.
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss below the breakout level for long trades or above the breakout level for short trades.
   - Use the Average True Range (ATR) to set a dynamic stop loss if preferred.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. **Avoid Overtrading**:
   - Only take trades with clear breakout confirmation and Stochastic alignment.
3. **Avoid News Events**:
   - Do not trade during high-impact news events to avoid false breakouts.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** - For momentum confirmation.
2. **Support/Resistance Levels** - For identifying breakout zones.
3. **Optional: ATR (14)** - For dynamic stop loss placement.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets. Avoid using it in choppy or sideways markets.
- Always backtest the strategy on historical data to ensure its effectiveness in your chosen market.
- Combine this strategy with other technical tools (e.g., moving averages, volume analysis) for additional confirmation if needed.
