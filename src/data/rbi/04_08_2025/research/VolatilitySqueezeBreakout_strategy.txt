STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify volatility compression periods (squeeze) followed by high-volume breakouts, using an adaptive trailing stop for exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Squeeze Detection:
   - Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
   - Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier)
   - Squeeze occurs when Bollinger Bands are inside Keltner Channels

2. Volume Filter:
   - 50-day average volume as baseline
   - Requires breakout volume > 2x average volume

3. Exit Mechanism:
   - 14-day ATR for volatility measurement
   - Trailing stop set at 2x ATR value

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for confirmed squeeze (BB inside KC for at least 3 candles)
2. Enter on first candle that:
   - Closes outside both bands (breakout)
   - Has volume > 2x 50-day average
   - Direction matches breakout (long for upper breakout, short for lower)

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop:
   - For longs: Highest high minus (2 x 14-day ATR)
   - For shorts: Lowest low plus (2 x 14-day ATR)
   - Adjust daily based on new extremes

2. Emergency Exit:
   - If price re-enters squeeze zone (BB back inside KC)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop distance = 2 x ATR
3. Maximum position size = (Account risk %) / (Stop distance in %)
4. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Keltner Channels (20,1.5)
3. Volume (50-day average)
4. ATR (14-day)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ATR multiples (1.5-3x) for trailing stop
- Experiment with squeeze duration (2-5 candles)
- Consider adding MACD confirmation for stronger trends

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the squeeze as a volatility predictor and volume as confirmation of breakout validity. The adaptive trailing stop locks in profits during strong moves while giving room during normal volatility.
