STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicPulse strategy is a sophisticated volatility-based trading system that combines short-term ATR momentum with VIX sentiment analysis for precise market entries, protected by an adaptive trailing stop mechanism.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses 5-minute ATR (14-period) to gauge immediate price volatility
2. Trend Filter: 20-period EMA of ATR identifies volatility expansion
3. Market Sentiment: VIX 20-day average acts as a fear gauge filter
4. Dynamic Exit: 2x ATR trailing stop locks in profits while allowing room for volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 5-minute ATR crosses ABOVE its 20-period EMA
2. Confirmation Filter: Current VIX reading must be BELOW its 20-day average
3. Execution: Enter long position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: Maintains a dynamic exit at 2x the current ATR value below price
2. Stop Adjustment: Updates stop level whenever price makes a new high
3. No time-based exit - remains in trade until stop is hit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Recommended 1-2% risk per trade based on stop distance
2. Volatility Adjustment: Larger ATR values automatically widen stops
3. Market Filter: VIX condition prevents entries during high fear periods

Required Indicators:
1. ATR (14-period) on 5-minute chart
2. 20-period EMA of ATR
3. VIX index with 20-day simple moving average
4. Trailing stop calculator (2x current ATR value)

Unique Advantages:
1. Dual volatility assessment (price + sentiment)
2. Adaptive position sizing based on current market conditions
3. High-probability entries during low-volatility regimes
4. Automatic risk adjustment through dynamic trailing stop

Optimization Notes:
- ATR period can be tuned between 10-20 periods
- EMA period can range 15-25 periods
- Stop multiplier can adjust between 1.5-3x ATR
- VIX average period can test 15-30 days

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, avoiding high-volatility chop while capitalizing on emerging momentum with built-in protection against volatility spikes.
