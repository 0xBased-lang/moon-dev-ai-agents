STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeFlowBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility where the bands contract, often preceding significant price movements.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) Confirmation:** Uses the 15-minute CMF crossing above zero to validate bullish momentum during the squeeze.  
3. **Measured Move Target:** The profit target is set at 1.5x the width of the Bollinger Band squeeze at the time of entry.  
4. **Stop Loss Placement:** The stop loss is placed at the lower Bollinger Band to protect against false breakouts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Wait for a Bollinger Band squeeze (contraction of the bands to a predefined threshold, e.g., bands within 1.5% of each other).  
- Confirm the 15-minute Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) crosses above zero, indicating bullish money flow.  
- Enter a long position on the breakout candle closing above the upper Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Calculate the width of the Bollinger Band squeeze (distance between upper and lower bands at entry) and set the target at 1.5x this width above the entry price.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place the stop loss at the lower Bollinger Band at the time of entry.  
- **Optional Trailing Stop:** Consider moving the stop loss to breakeven or trailing it below recent swing lows once the trade reaches 1x the squeeze width in profit.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with the distance between entry and stop loss to ensure risk per trade is limited (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods to reduce false signals.  
- Only trade when both conditions (squeeze + CMF crossover) align to increase the probability of success.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – To identify the squeeze and define entry/exit levels.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (15-minute, 20-period)** – To confirm bullish money flow.  
3. **Price Chart (15-minute timeframe recommended)** – For visual confirmation of the breakout.  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets but may produce false signals in choppy or range-bound conditions.  
- Backtest to optimize the squeeze threshold (e.g., band width percentage) and CMF period for your chosen asset.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend analysis (e.g., daily chart alignment) to filter higher-probability trades.
