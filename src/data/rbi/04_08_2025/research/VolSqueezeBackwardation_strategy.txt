STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBackwardation

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band squeeze breakouts with volume delta confirmation, filtered by VIX term structure conditions for high-probability trades. The unique combination of volatility compression, order flow imbalance, and market fear structure creates a powerful confluence setup.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze (20,2)
2. Volume Delta (buying/selling pressure)
3. VIX Term Structure (backwardation confirmation)
4. Breakout Direction (price closing outside bands)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: 
   - Bollinger Band width reaches lowest 20% of 100-period range (squeeze condition)
   - Price closes outside the Bollinger Bands (breakout)

2. Confirmation Filters:
   - Volume Delta shows strong imbalance (>2:1 ratio) in breakout direction
   - VIX term structure in backwardation (front month > second month)

3. Directional Bias:
   - Long entries only when breakout occurs above upper band
   - Short entries only when breakout occurs below lower band

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - 1.5x average true range (ATR) target from entry
   - OR when price re-enters Bollinger Band envelope

2. Stop Loss:
   - Fixed at 0.75x ATR from entry
   - OR when opposite Volume Delta extreme occurs

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum 2% risk per trade
   - Adjust position size based on ATR stop distance

2. Trade Filtering:
   - Only trade during regular market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
   - Avoid earnings announcement periods
   - Minimum $5 stock price requirement

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume Delta (cumulative or bar-by-bar)
3. VIX Futures Term Structure
4. Average True Range (14-period)
5. Bollinger Band Width indicator

Special Notes:
- Backwardation in VIX suggests heightened near-term fear, increasing breakout validity
- Volume Delta confirms institutional participation in the breakout direction
- The squeeze identifies periods of maximum volatility compression before expansion
- Works best on liquid stocks with average daily volume >1M shares

Optimization Tips:
- Test different squeeze thresholds (15-25% bandwidth)
- Experiment with volume delta ratios (1.5:1 to 3:1)
- Consider adding RSI(2) filter for extreme conditions
- Best timeframes: 15min-4hr charts for swing trades
