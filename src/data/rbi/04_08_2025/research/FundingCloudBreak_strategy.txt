STRATEGY_NAME: FundingCloudBreak

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Strategy Components:
1. Funding Rate Extremes: Uses perpetual swap funding rates exceeding 90th percentile as a contrarian signal
2. Ichimoku Cloud Break: Requires price confirmation below the Ichimoku Cloud (Senkou Span)
3. Kijun-sen Exit: Uses the baseline (Kijun-sen) as trend confirmation for exits
4. ATR Stop: Incorporates volatility-based risk management

Entry Rules:
1. Funding Rate Condition: Current funding rate must be above its 90th percentile (calculated over a relevant lookback period)
2. Price Position: Price must break below the Ichimoku Cloud (both Senkou Span A and B)
3. Timing: Wait for candle close confirmation below the Cloud

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: 4-hour candle close above the Kijun-sen (Ichimoku baseline)
2. Stop Loss: Place stop at 2xATR(14) below entry price
3. Optional Profit Target: Consider 1:2 risk-reward ratio based on ATR

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Allocate no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Volatility Adjustment: Use ATR to determine appropriate stop distance
3. Market Context: Avoid trading during major news events that may distort funding rates

Required Indicators:
1. Perpetual Swap Funding Rate (with percentile calculation)
2. Ichimoku Cloud (all components)
3. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period recommended
4. Historical volatility metrics for percentile calculations

Optimization Notes:
1. Backtest different lookback periods for funding rate percentiles (30-90 days recommended)
2. Experiment with ATR multiples for stop placement (1.5x-3x range)
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for breakouts
4. Test across different asset classes as funding rate dynamics vary

This strategy combines mean-reversion signals (extreme funding) with trend confirmation (Ichimoku) and volatility-based risk management, making it particularly suited for crypto markets where funding rate extremes frequently occur.
