STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth 10-Day Low:** Identifies periods of low volatility, suggesting an impending breakout.  
2. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO):** Confirms breakout momentum when crossing above/below zero.  
3. **2x ATR Trailing Stop:** Manages risk by dynamically adjusting exit points based on volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 10-day low (indicating low volatility).  
  - CMO crosses **above zero** (confirming bullish momentum).  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 10-day low.  
  - CMO crosses **below zero** (confirming bearish momentum).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit positions when price moves against the trade by **2x ATR** (Average True Range) from the highest profit point.  
- **Optional Time Exit:** Consider closing trades after a fixed period (e.g., 5-10 bars) if the trailing stop isnâ€™t hit.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop can be set at **1.5x ATR** from entry if not using trailing stop from the start.  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if ATR is excessively high (adjust threshold based on asset).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2 default settings) + Bandwidth Calculation:**  
   - Bandwidth = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band.  
2. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO, 14-period default):**  
   - Confirms momentum direction.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-period):**  
   - Sets trailing stop distance.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **low volatility detection** (Bollinger Bandwidth) with **momentum confirmation** (CMO).  
- Uses **adaptive exits** via ATR, making it responsive to market conditions.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring both technical conditions to align.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different lookback periods for Bandwidth lows (e.g., 5-20 days).  
- Adjust CMO period for sensitivity (shorter = more signals, longer = fewer but stronger).  
- Fine-tune ATR multiplier (e.g., 1.5x-3x) based on asset volatility.  

**Note:** Works best in **ranging markets transitioning to trends**; may underperform in sustained trends or choppy conditions.
