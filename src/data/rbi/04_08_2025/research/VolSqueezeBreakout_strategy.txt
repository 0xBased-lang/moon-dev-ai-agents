STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume analysis, and order flow dynamics to identify high-probability breakout trades with systematic risk management.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze: Identifies consolidation zones when bands narrow significantly (typically below 20% of their 6-month range)
2. Volume Decline: Confirms decreasing market interest during consolidation (volume below 20-period MA)
3. Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Spike: Entry trigger showing sudden institutional interest (>2 standard deviations from 14-period mean)
4. Chande Kroll Stop: Adaptive trailing stop for position management (default 10-period, 3x ATR multiplier)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Setup:
   - Bollinger Band width (Upper-Lower) < 20th percentile of 6-month range
   - Volume below 20-period moving average for 3+ consecutive periods
2. Entry Trigger:
   - Taker Buy/Sell Ratio spikes >2Ïƒ above 14-period mean
   - Price closes outside Bollinger Band
3. Entry Execution:
   - 50% position at breakout close
   - 50% on retest of breakout level (if occurs)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Scale out at 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 risk-reward ratios
   - Final position trails with Chande Kroll Stop
2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop at opposite Bollinger Band
   - Moves to breakeven at 1:1 R/R
   - Then follows Chande Kroll Stop

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum Drawdown: 5% daily, 15% monthly
3. Filter: Only trade when VIX is between 15-40 (adjust for market regime)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume + 20-period MA
3. Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (14-period mean + StdDev)
4. Chande Kroll Stop (10,3)
5. VIX filter

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust Bollinger Band squeeze threshold based on asset volatility
- Taker Ratio sensitivity should be calibrated per exchange
- Chande Kroll parameters can be optimized for different timeframes

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the combination of volatility compression, volume confirmation, and order flow dynamics to filter false breakouts. The multi-stage exit approach locks in profits while allowing runners to capture extended trends.
