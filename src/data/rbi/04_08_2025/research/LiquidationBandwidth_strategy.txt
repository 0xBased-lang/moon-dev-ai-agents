STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandwidth  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of extreme low volatility when the Bollinger Band Width falls below its 1-year low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Liquidation Cluster Maps:** Monitors sudden spikes in liquidations derived from funding rate anomalies, indicating potential market imbalances.  
3. **Dominant Liquidation Cascade:** Determines the direction of the breakout by analyzing the dominant liquidation pressure (long or short squeezes).  
4. **Volatility-Adjusted Pivot Ranges:** Uses dynamic stop-loss levels based on recent volatility to manage risk effectively.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger Condition:** Bollinger Band Width contracts below its 1-year low.  
- **Confirmation Signal:** A sudden spike in liquidation cluster maps (long or short liquidations) occurs alongside funding rate anomalies.  
- **Trade Direction:** Enter in the direction of the dominant liquidation cascade (e.g., long if short liquidations dominate, short if long liquidations dominate).  
- **Entry Execution:** Enter on the breakout of the Bollinger Band in the direction of the liquidation pressure.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take-Profit:** Use a trailing stop based on volatility-adjusted pivot ranges (e.g., 2x ATR from entry).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place a dynamic stop at the opposite Bollinger Band or a recent pivot low/high, adjusted for volatility (e.g., 1.5x ATR).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., risk 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or when funding rates are excessively skewed.  
- Exit trades if liquidation pressure reverses abruptly.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev) + Band Width calculation.  
2. Liquidation cluster maps (real-time data from exchanges or APIs).  
3. Funding rate anomaly detection (deviation from historical mean).  
4. ATR (14-period) for volatility adjustments.  
5. Pivot points (daily/weekly) for dynamic stop placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction with liquidation-driven momentum.  
- Uses real-time liquidation data for directional bias.  
- Adapts stops based on volatility and pivot ranges for dynamic risk management.  

This strategy is best suited for high-volatility assets (e.g., crypto) where liquidations play a significant role in price movements.
