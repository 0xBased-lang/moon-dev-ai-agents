STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Chaikin Oscillator Divergence:** Detects bullish/bearish divergence between price and money flow momentum.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies low-volatility accumulation phases ("the squeeze").  
3. **Volume-Confirmed Breakout:** Requires above-average volume to validate exits.  

**Entry Rules (Long Example):**  
- **Prerequisite:** Bollinger Band width (BBW) below its 20-period average (low volatility).  
- **Signal:** Bullish Chaikin divergence (price makes lower low, oscillator makes higher low).  
- **Confirmation:** Price closes inside Bollinger Bands (not a breakout yet).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Price closes outside Bollinger Bands WITH volume > 20-period average.  
- **Stop Loss:** Recent swing low (for longs) or trailing 2x ATR below entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size capped at 2% account risk per trade.  
- No entries if BBW > average (avoid high volatility).  
- Filter: Only trade if ADX(14) < 25 (no strong trend).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Chaikin Oscillator (3,10 EMA difference of Accum/Dist).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + BBW calculation.  
3. Volume MA (20-period).  
4. ADX (14-period) for trend filter.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines "smart money" flow (Chaikin) with volatility cycles, avoiding false breakouts via volume confirmation. Works best on 4H/daily charts for swing trades.
