STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility that typically precede significant price movements, using a combination of Bollinger Bands and historical volatility measurements.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. 10-day Historical Volatility (HV) calculation
3. Volatility contraction threshold (custom parameter)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width must contract to below 70% of the 10-day HV reading
   - Band Width = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band
   - Compare to 10-day HV (standard deviation of logarithmic returns)
2. Secondary Confirmation: Price must be trading between the bands at time of entry
3. Entry Execution: Market order long when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Close position when price closes above Upper Bollinger Band
2. Stop-Loss: Close position when price closes below Lower Bollinger Band
3. Optional Time Exit: Close after 5 bars if neither target nor stop is hit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance between entry price and lower band stop
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. Volatility-adjusted position sizing (reduce size during high HV periods)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Historical Volatility (10-day)
3. Band Width Calculator
4. Price relative to bands monitor

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different contraction thresholds (60-80% of HV)
2. Experiment with band periods (14-30) and deviations (1.5-2.5)
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for entries

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, and requires careful monitoring of the volatility contraction phase. The unique combination of relative band width and historical volatility comparison creates a more precise entry signal than standard squeeze strategies.
