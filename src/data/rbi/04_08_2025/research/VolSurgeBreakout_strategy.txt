STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Entries**: Uses Bollinger Bands (2-standard deviation) to identify extreme price movements signaling potential breakouts.  
2. **Volume Confirmation**: Requires a 50% increase in volume compared to the 20-day average to validate the breakout, reducing false signals.  
3. **Mean-Reversion Exits**: Closes positions when price retraces to the 1-standard deviation Bollinger Band, locking in profits or cutting losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when price closes *above* the upper 2-standard deviation Bollinger Band AND volume is ≥ 150% of the 20-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry**: Triggered when price closes *below* the lower 2-standard deviation Bollinger Band AND volume is ≥ 150% of the 20-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: Close position when price touches or crosses *below* the upper 1-standard deviation Bollinger Band.  
- **Short Exit**: Close position when price touches or crosses *above* the lower 1-standard deviation Bollinger Band.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: Optional trailing stop set at the 2-standard deviation band (entry level) to protect against reversals.  
2. **Position Sizing**: Allocate ≤ 2% of capital per trade to limit risk exposure.  
3. **Time Filter**: Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., holidays, overnight gaps).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 and 1 standard deviations).  
2. **Volume** (20-day average + real-time comparison).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility expansion with volume surge, filtering noise while capitalizing on high-probability breakouts. Suitable for intraday or swing trading in trending markets.  

**Note**: Backtest parameters (e.g., 20-period SMA, 2σ) can be optimized for specific assets/timeframes.
