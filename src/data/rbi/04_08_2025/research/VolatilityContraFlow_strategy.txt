STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityContraFlow

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated mean-reversion strategy that capitalizes on excessive volatility expansions when accompanied by declining trading volume, signaling potential exhaustion moves.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Expansion: Uses the bandwidth (difference between upper and lower bands) as primary volatility measure
2. Volume Divergence: Requires declining volume during volatility expansion
3. Mean Reversion: Targets returns to average volatility conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger: When Bollinger Band width exceeds 2 standard deviations from its 20-period moving average
2. Confirmation: Volume must be declining for at least 3 consecutive periods during the bandwidth expansion
3. Direction: Enter short if price is in upper band, long if in lower band

Exit Rules:
1. Primary: When bandwidth returns within 1 standard deviation of its mean
2. Secondary: Fixed 2:1 risk-reward ratio (adjustable)
3. Emergency: Hard stop at opposite band level

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop at opposite band level
3. Maximum Drawdown: 5% account limit before strategy review

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator
3. Volume oscillator (to confirm declining trend)
4. Standard deviation calculator for bandwidth

Optimization Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets
- Avoid during strong trending conditions
- Ideal timeframe: 4H to daily charts
- Best asset classes: Forex majors, large-cap equities

The "VolatilityContraFlow" name reflects both the volatility-based nature and contrarian approach of this strategy, while emphasizing the importance of volume flow divergence as confirmation.
