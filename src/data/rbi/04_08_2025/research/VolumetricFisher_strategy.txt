STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricFisher  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Fisher Transform**: A technical indicator that transforms price data into a Gaussian normal distribution, helping identify potential reversals and trend continuations.  
2. **Volume-Weighted MACD Divergence**: A modified MACD that incorporates trading volume to confirm momentum strength and divergence signals.  
3. **Parabolic SAR**: A trailing stop indicator used to determine exit points by identifying potential trend reversals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. Fisher Transform crosses above its signal line (indicating bullish momentum).  
  2. Volume-Weighted MACD shows bullish divergence (price makes a lower low, but MACD makes a higher low).  
  3. Both signals must align to confirm trend acceleration.  

- **Short Entry**:  
  1. Fisher Transform crosses below its signal line (indicating bearish momentum).  
  2. Volume-Weighted MACD shows bearish divergence (price makes a higher high, but MACD makes a lower high).  
  3. Both signals must align to confirm trend acceleration.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: Parabolic SAR dots flip below the price (indicating a potential reversal).  
- **Short Exit**: Parabolic SAR dots flip above the price (indicating a potential reversal).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: Set at the recent swing low (for long) or swing high (for short).  
2. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
3. **Trailing Stop**: Use Parabolic SAR to trail profits dynamically.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Fisher Transform (with signal line).  
2. Volume-Weighted MACD (standard settings: 12, 26, 9).  
3. Parabolic SAR (default settings: step = 0.02, max = 0.2).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets (avoid choppy/range-bound conditions).  
- Volume confirmation is critical to filter false signals.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend analysis for stronger conviction.  

This strategy leverages the unique combination of Fisher Transform's normalization and volume-weighted MACD divergence to capture high-probability momentum trades, while Parabolic SAR ensures disciplined exits.
