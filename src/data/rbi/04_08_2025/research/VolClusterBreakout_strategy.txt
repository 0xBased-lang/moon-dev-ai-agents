STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Adjusted VWAP Channel**: Uses a VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) channel dynamically adjusted for volatility to identify breakout zones.  
2. **Liquidation Volume Confirmation**: Requires a surge in liquidation volume clusters (detected via order flow or volume delta) to validate breakout strength.  
3. **Fractal Volatility Stop-Loss**: Implements a dynamic stop-loss based on recent fractal volatility levels (e.g., ATR or standard deviation of price swings).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Price closes above the upper VWAP channel band + liquidation volume surge (e.g., 2x average volume delta).  
- **Short Entry**: Price closes below the lower VWAP channel band + liquidation volume surge.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take-Profit**: Fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) or trailing stop based on fractal volatility.  
- **Stop-Loss**: Placed at recent fractal swing low (long) or high (short), adjusted by volatility multiplier (e.g., 1.5x ATR).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., 1% risk per trade, stop-loss distance determines lot size).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or if volatility exceeds a threshold (e.g., ATR > 3x median).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. VWAP with Â±2 standard deviation bands (volatility-adjusted).  
2. Volume delta or liquidation volume detector (e.g., cumulative delta divergence).  
3. Fractal volatility measure (e.g., ATR, Keltner Channels).  
4. Price action confirmation (e.g., closing break of channel).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines institutional-level VWAP dynamics with retail-driven liquidation clusters, filtered by adaptive volatility stops.
