STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySentinel  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Put/Call Ratio Filter:** Uses the 3-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the put/call ratio to gauge market sentiment.  
2. **Median Crossover Trigger:** Requires the 3-day EMA to cross above the 21-day median of the put/call ratio, signaling a potential shift in sentiment.  
3. **VIX Term Structure Confirmation:** Only enters trades when the VIX futures term structure is inverted (backwardation), indicating heightened near-term volatility expectations.  
4. **Volatility-Based Exit:** Exits positions when price movement reaches 2x the daily realized volatility, ensuring dynamic risk-adjusted profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** 3-day EMA of the put/call ratio crosses above its 21-day median.  
- **Condition 2:** VIX futures term structure is inverted (near-month contract > further-month contract).  
- **Action:** Enter short position (assuming bearish sentiment) upon confirmation of both conditions.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Volatility Threshold:** Exit the trade when the price moves against the position by 2x the daily realized volatility (e.g., if daily realized volatility is 1%, exit at Â±2%).  
- **Alternative Exit:** Consider a time-based exit (e.g., 5-10 days) if volatility thresholds are not hit, to avoid prolonged exposure.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate no more than 2-3% of capital per trade due to the high volatility nature of the strategy.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Use the 2x daily realized volatility threshold as a dynamic stop-loss.  
3. **Diversification:** Avoid overconcentration in a single asset; apply to broad indices (e.g., SPX) or high-liquidity ETFs.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Put/Call Ratio (daily data).  
2. 3-day EMA and 21-day median of the put/call ratio.  
3. VIX futures term structure (near-month vs. next-month contracts).  
4. Daily realized volatility (standard deviation of recent price movements).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines sentiment (put/call ratio), term structure (VIX inversion), and adaptive volatility thresholds for precise, high-probability bearish entries in volatile regimes.
