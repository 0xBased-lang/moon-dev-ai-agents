STRATEGY_NAME: VolBand Reversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume-confirmed RSI overbought conditions to identify high-probability short-term reversal opportunities.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures when volatility reaches extreme lows (below 10-day minimum)
2. Volume-Weighted RSI (VWRSI): Confirms overbought conditions with volume validation (above 70 threshold)
3. Bollinger Band Touch Exit: Uses the lower band as natural profit target

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band Width (20,2) contracts below its 10-day low
2. Confirmation: Volume-Weighted RSI (14-period) surges above 70
3. Execution: Enter short position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Exit when price touches the lower Bollinger Band
2. Stop Loss: Initial stop placed at recent swing high (above entry candle)
3. Time Exit: Close position after 5 days if target not hit

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Dynamic - adjusts to new swing highs if price moves against position
3. Filter: Only trade in overall downtrend (200EMA below price)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Standard deviation calculation
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator (BB Width)
3. Volume-Weighted RSI (standard 14-period RSI multiplied by volume ratio)
4. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (trend filter)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different RSI thresholds (65-75 range)
- Experiment with BB Width lookback periods (5-15 days)
- Consider adding volume spike confirmation (e.g., 150% of 20-day average volume)
