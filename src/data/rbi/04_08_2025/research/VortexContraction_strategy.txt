STRATEGY_NAME: VortexContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines three technical indicators for high-probability trend entries
- Uses Vortex Indicator (VI) for primary trend confirmation
- Bollinger Band width contraction identifies low volatility periods
- ADX measures trend strength development
- Looks for alignment between volatility contraction and emerging trend strength

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: VI+ (positive trend) must be above VI- (negative trend) for long entries
- Secondary Condition: Bollinger Band width must be below its 20-period average (contraction)
- Tertiary Condition: ADX must be rising and above 25 (developing trend strength)
- Entry Trigger: Price closes above the middle Bollinger Band (20MA) for long positions

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: Price touches upper Bollinger Band (take partial profits)
- Secondary Exit: VI+ crosses below VI- (trend reversal signal)
- Stop Loss: Recent swing low (for longs) or swing high (for shorts)
- Emergency Exit: ADX begins declining sharply (trend losing momentum)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Initial stop placed at swing point beyond Bollinger Band
- Trailing stop activated after price moves 1.5x ATR in profit
- Maximum portfolio exposure limited to 5 open positions

5. Required Indicators:
- Vortex Indicator (VI) with standard 14-period setting
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation
- ADX (14-period) with +DI/-DI lines
- Optional: ATR (14) for volatility measurement and stop placement

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trading
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Most effective in trending markets, less during choppy conditions
- Requires confirmation from at least 2 of 3 indicators for entries
- Backtest suggested for optimal parameter tuning per instrument
