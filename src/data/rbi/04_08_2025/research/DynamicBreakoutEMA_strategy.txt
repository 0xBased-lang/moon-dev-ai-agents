STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicBreakoutEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation, momentum strength, and volatility-based exits for high-probability breakout trading.

Key Components:
1. Trend Confirmation: Uses the 50/200 EMA crossover as a golden cross signal
2. Momentum Filter: Requires ADX > 25 to confirm strong trending conditions
3. Volatility Management: Uses ATR for stop-loss and percentage-based trailing stop

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50-period EMA must cross ABOVE 200-period EMA
2. Confirmation Filter: ADX must be rising and above 25 level
3. Entry Trigger: Price must break above the most recent swing high after conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Protective Stop: 2x ATR (Average True Range) from entry price
2. Profit Protection: 5% trailing stop activates once price moves 5% in profit
3. Optional Exit: Consider closing when ADX begins declining below 30

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop at 2x ATR (adjust based on volatility)
3. Trade Filter: Only take trades when ADX confirms strong trend (above 25)

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Average Directional Index (ADX) - 14 period recommended
4. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period for stop calculation

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for daily or 4-hour timeframes in trending markets
- Works well with liquid assets showing clear trends
- Combine with price action confirmation for higher accuracy
- Avoid trading during low ADX periods (below 25) as false breakouts are more likely

Optimization Tips:
- Test different ATR multiples (1.5x-3x) for stop placement
- Experiment with ADX thresholds (20-30) for different assets
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
