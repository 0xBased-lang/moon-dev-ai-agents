STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Breakout Focus:** The strategy targets breakouts when price closes outside the Keltner Channel, indicating a potential expansion in volatility.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires volume to surge above its 20-day moving average (MA) to validate the breakout, ensuring participation and reducing false signals.  
3. **Exit Mechanism:** Uses RSI crossover for early exits and a dynamic trailing stop to lock in profits while allowing for trend continuation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Price closes **above the upper Keltner Channel band** (indicating bullish breakout).  
  2. Volume exceeds its **20-day moving average** (confirms strong interest).  
  3. Optional: RSI (14-period) is below 70 (avoids overbought conditions).  

- **Short Entry (if applicable):**  
  1. Price closes **below the lower Keltner Channel band** (bearish breakout).  
  2. Volume exceeds its **20-day MA**.  
  3. Optional: RSI above 30 (avoids oversold conditions).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:**  
  - **RSI Crossover:** Exit long when RSI crosses **below 70** (for longs) or above 30 (for shorts).  
- **Dynamic Trailing Stop:**  
  - For longs: Trail stop at the **lowest low of the last 3 bars** or a fixed ATR multiple (e.g., 1.5x ATR).  
  - For shorts: Trail stop at the **highest high of the last 3 bars**.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop placed at the **opposite Keltner band** or a recent swing low/high.  
3. **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if ATR is below a threshold (e.g., 50% of its 20-day MA), indicating low volatility.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channel** (20-period EMA, 2x ATR bands).  
2. **Volume 20-day MA**.  
3. **RSI (14-period)**.  
4. **ATR (14-period)** for trailing stops/volatility filter.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **volume surge** with **volatility breakout**, reducing false signals.  
- Uses **dynamic trailing stops** to capture extended moves while protecting gains.  
- Optional RSI filter prevents entries in overextended conditions.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize parameters (e.g., Keltner band multiplier, RSI thresholds) for specific assets.
