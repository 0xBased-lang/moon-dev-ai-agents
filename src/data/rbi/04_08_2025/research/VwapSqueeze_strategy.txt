STRATEGY_NAME: VwapSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP):** Acts as the primary trend and mean-reversion reference.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility (contraction) that often precede significant price movements.  
3. **VWAP Slope Reversal:** Used as an exit signal when the trend direction changes.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands show contraction (squeeze condition).  
  2. Price breaks **above** the VWAP with confirmation (e.g., closing candle above VWAP).  
  3. Volume increases on the breakout for added confirmation.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands show contraction (squeeze condition).  
  2. Price breaks **below** the VWAP with confirmation (e.g., closing candle below VWAP).  
  3. Volume increases on the breakdown for added confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  1. VWAP slope turns downward (indicating weakening bullish momentum).  
  2. Price closes back below VWAP.  

- **Short Exit:**  
  1. VWAP slope turns upward (indicating weakening bearish momentum).  
  2. Price closes back above VWAP.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - For long trades: Place below the recent swing low or below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  - For short trades: Place above the recent swing high or above the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Take-Profit:**  
  - Use a trailing stop based on VWAP slope reversal or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price) – Primary trend filter.  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To identify squeeze conditions.  
3. **Volume Indicator** – Confirms breakout strength.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in **ranging or consolidating markets** where volatility contractions precede strong moves.  
- Avoid trading during **low-volume periods** as false breakouts are more likely.  
- Combine with **higher timeframe trend alignment** for better success rate.  

This strategy capitalizes on the synergy between volatility contraction (Bollinger Squeeze) and institutional price reference (VWAP), making it ideal for intraday or swing trading.
