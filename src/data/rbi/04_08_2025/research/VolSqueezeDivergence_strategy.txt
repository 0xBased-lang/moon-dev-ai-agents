STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three powerful technical indicators to identify high-probability trade setups during low volatility periods with emerging momentum. The core concept revolves around catching the initial breakout from a volatility contraction with confirmation from volume-weighted momentum.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction (10th percentile threshold)
2. Volume-Weighted RSI Divergence (14-period RSI with volume multiplier)
3. Keltner Channel Breakout (20-period ATR-based channel)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2) must be below its 10th percentile value (measured over 100 periods)
2. Confirmation: Volume-Weighted RSI (14-period) shows bullish divergence (higher low in RSI while price makes lower low)
3. Execution: Enter long when price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with above-average volume

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: Trail stop at lower Keltner Channel (20-period EMA Â± 2.5*ATR)
2. Stop Loss: Initial stop placed at recent swing low or lower Bollinger Band, whichever is closer
3. Emergency Exit: Immediate exit if Keltner Channel width expands beyond 2x its entry value

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum portfolio exposure capped at 5% during high volatility regimes
3. Trade frequency limited to 1-2 setups per week to avoid over-trading

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with Bandwidth calculation
2. Volume-Weighted RSI (standard 14-period RSI multiplied by volume ratio)
3. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA with 2.5*ATR bands)
4. Volume indicator (for confirmation of breakout)

Optimal Market Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases
- Avoid during high volatility or strongly trending markets
- Most effective on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trading

The unique combination of volatility contraction, volume-confirmed momentum divergence, and volatility expansion signals creates a high-probability trading edge with clearly defined risk parameters.
