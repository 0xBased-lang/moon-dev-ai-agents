STRATEGY_NAME: VoidBreakoutDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Heikin-Ashi trend filtering, volatility channel breakouts, and liquidity analysis with volume/open interest divergence for high-probability Asian session trades.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candles (4H): Smoothed price action to filter trend direction
2. Keltner Channel (20-period, 2xATR): Volatility-based dynamic support/resistance
3. Asian Session (00:00-08:00 GMT): Focus on liquidity voids for cleaner breakouts
4. Open Interest/Volume Ratios: Divergence filter to confirm breakout validity

Entry Rules:
1. LONG Entry:
   - Heikin-Ashi candle closes ABOVE upper Keltner band
   - Volume decreases while Open Interest increases (bullish divergence)
   - Time between 00:00-08:00 GMT

2. SHORT Entry:
   - Heikin-Ashi candle closes BELOW lower Keltner band
   - Volume decreases while Open Interest increases (bearish divergence)
   - Time between 00:00-08:00 GMT

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - 1.5x ATR from entry price (volatility-adjusted target)
   - OR when Heikin-Ashi color changes (trend reversal signal)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Opposite Keltner band (dynamic stop)
   - OR 1x ATR from entry (whichever is closer)

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum Daily Trades: 2 (to avoid over-trading liquidity voids)
3. Time Filter: Only trade during specified Asian session hours
4. Divergence Requirement: Must have confirming OI/volume pattern

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candles (4H timeframe)
2. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2xATR multiplier)
3. Volume and Open Interest indicators
4. ATR (14-period for volatility measurement)

Special Notes:
- Works best on currency pairs with high Asian session liquidity (USD/JPY, AUD/USD)
- Requires monitoring futures market open interest data
- Most effective during Tokyo/London session overlap (02:00-04:00 GMT)
- Avoid news events that may distort volume patterns

This strategy capitalizes on the combination of technical breakout signals during low-liquidity periods, filtered by smart money flow indicators (OI/volume divergence) for higher probability trades.
