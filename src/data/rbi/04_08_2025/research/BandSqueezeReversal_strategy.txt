STRATEGY_NAME: BandSqueezeReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with Heikin-Ashi trend confirmation and RSI overbought signals for precise mean-reversion entries. The unique combination of volatility measurement, smoothed price action, and momentum filtering creates a high-probability reversal system.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Filter (1.5% threshold)
2. Heikin-Ashi Trend Confirmation (3 consecutive bullish closes)
3. RSI Exit Trigger (5-period, 70 threshold)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below 1.5% (volatility squeeze condition)
2. Confirm with three consecutive bullish Heikin-Ashi closes (smoothed trend confirmation)
3. Enter long at the open of the next candle after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor 5-period RSI continuously after entry
2. Exit position when RSI crosses above 70 (overbought reversal signal)
3. Alternative exit: Consider closing if Bollinger Band width expands beyond 3% (volatility expansion)

Risk Management:
1. Recommended stop-loss at recent swing low or 1 ATR below entry
2. Position size should account for the volatility contraction context
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause sudden volatility spikes

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator (% calculation)
3. Heikin-Ashi candles (smoothed price series)
4. 5-period RSI (for exit timing)

Optimization Notes:
1. The 1.5% bandwidth threshold can be adjusted based on asset volatility (0.8-2% range)
2. RSI period and threshold can be tested between 3-7 periods and 65-75 levels
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy excels in ranging markets with clear volatility cycles, using the Bollinger squeeze to identify potential reversal points and Heikin-Ashi to filter false breakouts. The quick RSI exit captures profits before typical mean-reversion occurs.
