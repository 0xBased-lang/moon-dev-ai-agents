STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a volatility-based breakout strategy that combines EMA tracking with adaptive ATR bands for dynamic entry and exit signals. The strategy capitalizes on strong momentum moves while using volatility-adjusted stops for risk management.

Key Components:
1. Trend Baseline: 20-period EMA (center line)
2. Volatility Measurement: ATR (14-period recommended)
3. Entry Bands: ±(2xATR) from EMA
4. Exit Mechanism: EMA reversion or 1xATR trailing stop

Entry Rules:
- LONG when price closes ABOVE the Upper Band (EMA + 2xATR)
- SHORT when price closes BELOW the Lower Band (EMA - 2xATR)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Price closes on opposite side of EMA
2. Protective Exit: Trailing stop at 1xATR from extreme price
   - For longs: Trail stop at Highest High - 1xATR
   - For shorts: Trail stop at Lowest Low + 1xATR

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on ATR (risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital)
2. Natural stop distance = 2xATR (entry band width)
3. No trades during extremely low volatility (ATR below threshold)

Required Indicators:
1. EMA (20-period)
2. ATR (14-period)
3. Upper Band: EMA + (2 × ATR)
4. Lower Band: EMA - (2 × ATR)

Optimization Considerations:
1. EMA period (test 10-30 range)
2. ATR multiplier for bands (test 1.5-3 range)
3. ATR period (test 10-20 range)
4. Minimum ATR threshold for trade validity

This strategy works best in trending markets with consistent volatility, and may generate false signals during choppy or ranging conditions. The dual exit mechanism provides both trend-following and protective stop functionality.
