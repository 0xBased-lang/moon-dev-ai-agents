STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiditySurgeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on identifying high-probability breakout opportunities from clustered liquidation zones using a combination of order book analysis, volume surges, and momentum confirmation. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Zone Detection:
   - Monitor order book delta imbalances to identify clustered liquidation levels
   - These zones represent high-concentration areas where stop losses cluster

2. Confirmation Signals:
   - Requires 3x surge in trading volume compared to recent average
   - MACD histogram must show reversal pattern (slope change from negative to positive)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to approach identified liquidation zone
2. Confirm breakout when:
   - Price breaks through zone with closing confirmation
   - Volume surges to 3x recent average
   - MACD histogram shows bullish reversal
3. Enter on retest of broken level or immediate breakout continuation

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - Primary target: Next identified liquidity pool level
   - Secondary target: 1.5x risk (measured from entry to stop loss)
2. Stop Loss:
   - Place below recent swing low (for long) or above swing high (for short)
   - Alternative: Below the liquidation zone for longs, above for shorts

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Risk-reward ratio minimum 1:1.5
3. Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. Order Book Delta Imbalance indicator
2. Volume indicator (with average calculation)
3. MACD with histogram (standard settings: 12,26,9)
4. Liquidity pool identification tool

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets with significant order book depth
- Higher timeframe (1H+) provides more reliable signals
- Works particularly well during high volatility periods
- Requires constant monitoring of order book dynamics

This strategy combines the predictive power of liquidity analysis with technical confirmation, creating a robust framework for trading breakouts from key liquidation zones. The volume surge requirement helps filter false breakouts, while the MACD confirmation adds momentum validation to the setup.
