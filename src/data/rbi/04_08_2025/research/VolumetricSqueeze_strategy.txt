STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume-Weighted Rate of Change (ROC):** Measures price momentum adjusted for trading volume over a 3-day period.  
2. **Bollinger Bands:** Uses the midline (20-period SMA) as a dynamic reference for trend direction.  
3. **Keltner Channel Squeeze:** Identifies low volatility periods when the Keltner Channel narrows, often preceding breakouts.  
4. **ATR Trailing Stop:** Manages exits using a 2x ATR (Average True Range) trailing stop to capture trends while protecting profits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  1. The Keltner Channel shows narrowing volatility (squeeze condition).  
  2. The 3-day volume-weighted ROC crosses **above** the Bollinger Band midline (20-period SMA).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop Exit:** Close the position when price retraces **2x ATR** from its peak post-entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with the ATR to limit risk (e.g., 1% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid entries during high volatility (wide Keltner Channel) to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Volume-Weighted ROC (3-day period).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
3. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 1.5x ATR width).  
4. ATR (14-period for trailing stop).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volume-confirmed momentum (ROC) with volatility contraction (squeeze) for high-probability breakouts, while the ATR trailing stop adapts to market conditions.
