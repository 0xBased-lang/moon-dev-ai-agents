STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityShiftBand

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility regime shifts by combining historical volatility analysis with volume confirmation and Bollinger Band extremes for exits. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Key Components:
1. Volatility Regime Detection:
   - 10-day historical volatility (HV) as the primary signal
   - 30-day median volatility band as the threshold
2. Volume Confirmation:
   - Volume acceleration (increasing volume trend) required for entry
3. Exit Mechanism:
   - Bollinger Band extremes (typically Â±2 standard deviations) as profit targets

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - When 10-day HV crosses ABOVE the 30-day median volatility band
   - AND volume shows acceleration (e.g., 5-day volume MA > 20-day volume MA)
2. Short Entry:
   - When 10-day HV crosses BELOW the 30-day median volatility band
   - AND volume shows acceleration

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Close long position when price touches upper Bollinger Band
   - Close short position when price touches lower Bollinger Band
2. Stop Loss:
   - Trailing stop based on recent volatility (e.g., 2x ATR)
   - OR fixed percentage stop (e.g., 2% from entry)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Volatility-adjusted sizing (larger positions in lower volatility regimes)
2. Maximum Risk:
   - 1-2% of capital per trade
3. Trade Filter:
   - Only trade when volatility shift is significant (e.g., >15% change in HV ratio)

Required Indicators:
1. Historical Volatility (10-day and 30-day)
2. Volume Moving Averages (5-day and 20-day)
3. Bollinger Bands (20-day with 2 standard deviations)
4. Optional: ATR for stop loss calculation

Additional Notes:
- Works best in markets with clear volatility regimes
- Performs well during transitions between low and high volatility periods
- Requires monitoring of volume trends to confirm regime shifts
- Backtest suggested for optimal parameter tuning (volatility bands, BB settings)

This "VolatilityShiftBand" strategy is particularly effective in capturing the initial momentum when volatility regimes change, while using Bollinger Bands to capture the mean-reversion that typically follows such shifts.
