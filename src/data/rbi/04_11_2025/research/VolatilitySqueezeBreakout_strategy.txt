STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities, using dynamic risk management through opening-range anchored stops.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures periods of compressed volatility when the BB width falls below a historical percentile threshold
2. Volume Surge Filter: Requires trading volume to exceed its 20-period median to confirm breakout validity
3. Opening-Range Anchored Stop: Uses the breakout candle's range to set dynamic trailing stop levels

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below its X-period percentile (e.g., 20th percentile over 100 periods)
2. Confirm volume exceeds 20-period median volume
3. Enter long on break above upper Bollinger Band or short on break below lower Bollinger Band
4. Entry executes only if both conditions are met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Initial Stop: Set at opposite end of breakout candle's range (for longs: low of candle; for shorts: high of candle)
2. Trailing Stop: Adjust stop to maintain original candle range distance from price extreme
3. Profit Target: None specified - trail stop until exit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on stop distance to maintain consistent risk per trade
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. Stop placement ensures defined risk before entry
4. Volume filter reduces false breakout entries

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations recommended)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator (calculates Upper-Lower band difference)
3. Volume indicator with 20-period median calculation
4. Historical percentile calculator for BB width

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different percentile thresholds (15th-25th) for BB width contraction
2. Experiment with various lookback periods for percentile calculation
3. Consider adding time filter (e.g., only trade first 2 hours of session)
4. May combine with momentum oscillator for additional confirmation

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using volatility compression as a springboard for explosive moves confirmed by volume participation, while the anchored stop provides favorable risk-reward dynamics.
