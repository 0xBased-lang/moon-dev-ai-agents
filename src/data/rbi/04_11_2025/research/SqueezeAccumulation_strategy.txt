STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeAccumulation

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band compression with Herrick Payoff Index momentum to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during accumulation/distribution phases.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies periods of low volatility (squeeze)
2. Herrick Payoff Index (HPI) - Measures money flow and accumulation/distribution
3. Price Action - Confirms breakout direction
4. Swing Points - Defines stop-loss levels

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band squeeze (bands within 1.5x ATR of 20-period moving average)
2. Confirm HPI spike above 0.5 (accumulation) or below -0.5 (distribution)
3. Enter long on breakout above upper band (accumulation) or short below lower band (distribution)

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit at 1.5x ATR from entry point
2. Trail stop to breakeven after 0.5x ATR profit
3. Exit if HPI reverses direction (crosses back through zero)

Risk Management:
1. Stop-loss placed at most recent swing low (long) or swing high (short)
2. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
3. No trades during major economic news events

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Herrick Payoff Index (default settings)
3. ATR (14) for volatility measurement
4. Swing high/low detector

Optimization Tips:
1. Adjust HPI thresholds based on asset volatility
2. Test different ATR multiples for squeeze definition
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, capturing early momentum while maintaining tight risk control through the Bollinger Band squeeze setup.
