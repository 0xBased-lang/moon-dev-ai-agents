STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Uses VI+ (positive trend movement) and VI- (negative trend movement) crossovers to identify potential trend reversals.  
2. **Average Directional Index (ADX):** Measures trend strength, ensuring trades are taken only in strong trends (ADX >25).  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires volume to be at least 20% above the average to validate the strength of the signal.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** VI+ crosses above VI- while ADX >25 and volume is 20% above the average.  
- **Short Entry:** VI- crosses above VI+ while ADX >25 and volume is 20% above the average.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Long/Short:** ADX drops below 20, indicating weakening trend strength.  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** ATR-based stop-loss (e.g., 2x ATR) can be added for additional risk management.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Only trade when all three conditions (VI crossover, ADX >25, volume surge) are met to filter false signals.  
- Position sizing should align with volatility (e.g., using ATR to adjust trade size).  
- Avoid trading during low-volume or choppy market conditions (ADX <20).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)  
2. Average Directional Index (ADX)  
3. Volume (compared to its moving average, e.g., 20-period MA)  
4. Optional: Average True Range (ATR) for dynamic stop-loss placement.  

**Unique Edge:**  
The combination of VI crossovers, ADX trend strength, and volume confirmation creates a high-probability setup for strong trending moves while avoiding weak or false breakouts. The name "VortexSurge" reflects the synergy between the Vortex Indicator and the surge in volume/trend strength.
