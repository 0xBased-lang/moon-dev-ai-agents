STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Contrarian approach based on liquidation clusters (extreme market positioning)
- Volatility confirmation using Bollinger Band width contraction
- ATR-based profit targets for systematic exits

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Trigger: Liquidation clusters exceeding 200% of 30-day average (extreme market positioning)
- Confirmation Filter: Bollinger Band width (20,2) must be below 50% of its 14-day range (volatility contraction)
- Entry Point: Market order when both conditions are met

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit Target: 1.5x the 14-period ATR from entry price
- Stop Loss: No fixed stop - the liquidation cluster itself acts as implicit stop (extreme positioning suggests reversal likelihood)
- Time Exit: Close position if not triggered within 5 candles

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1% risk of capital relative to 1.5x ATR distance
- Only trade during main session hours (avoid thin liquidity periods)
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions across uncorrelated assets

5. Required Indicators:
- Liquidation cluster data (exchange-specific or from aggregators)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) for width calculation
- ATR (14) for profit targeting
- 30-day moving average of liquidation data

6. Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets with periodic overextensions
- Requires reliable liquidation data feed
- Most effective on 4H or daily timeframes
- Complementary to momentum strategies as hedge

7. Optimization Tips:
- Test different multiples for liquidation threshold (1.8x-2.5x)
- Experiment with Bollinger Band period (14-20) and width thresholds
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on asset volatility (1.2x-2x)
