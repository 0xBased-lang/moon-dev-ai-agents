STRATEGY_NAME: ClusterBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ClusterBandwidth strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction analysis with liquidity cluster detection for high-probability entries and ATR-based exits. This approach capitalizes on periods of low volatility preceding potential breakouts near key liquidity zones.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures periods of reduced volatility when bands narrow significantly
2. Liquidation Cluster Detection: Identifies dense order book areas where stop losses cluster
3. ATR-based Exit: Uses 2x ATR for dynamic profit-taking and stop management

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below its 20-period average (indicating compression)
2. Identify nearest liquidation cluster level (price zone with high stop order density)
3. Enter long when price breaks ABOVE the cluster level in an uptrend
4. Enter short when price breaks BELOW the cluster level in a downtrend

Exit Rules:
1. Set initial profit target at 2x current ATR(14) from entry price
2. Trail stop to breakeven +0.5x ATR once price reaches 1x ATR in profit
3. Exit entire position if price returns to cluster level (failed breakout)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at 1x ATR from entry
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 3% of account
4. Avoid trading during major news events when clusters may shift rapidly

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation
2. Liquidation cluster detection (order flow analysis tool)
3. ATR (14-period for volatility measurement)
4. Volume profile (for cluster confirmation)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different ATR multiples (1.5x-3x) for exits
2. Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (14-22)
3. Verify cluster detection sensitivity
4. Backtest during different volatility regimes

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the Bollinger contraction as a volatility filter and liquidity clusters as high-probability breakout points. The ATR-based exits ensure dynamic position management relative to current market conditions.
