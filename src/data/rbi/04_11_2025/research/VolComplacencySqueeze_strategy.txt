STRATEGY_NAME: VolComplacencySqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width contracts below a specific historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile). This signals a potential volatility squeeze.  
2. **Volume-Adjusted Skew Indicator:** A skewness metric adjusted for trading volume is used to detect market complacency. High skew (indicating extreme positioning) combined with low volatility suggests an overconfident market ripe for a reversal.  
3. **Short Volatility Position:** The strategy takes a short volatility position (e.g., via options, VIX futures, or volatility ETFs) when both conditions align.  
4. **Exit Triggers:** Positions are closed either on a volatility spike (e.g., Bollinger Band width expansion above a threshold) or upon hitting a predefined profit target (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Bollinger Band Width:** Calculate the rolling percentile of the Bollinger Band width (typically 20-period bands, 2 standard deviations). Enter when width falls below the 20th percentile.  
- **Skew Confirmation:** Ensure the volume-adjusted skew metric shows complacency (e.g., skew > +1 standard deviation from its mean).  
- **Timing:** Execute the short volatility trade at the close of the confirming candle.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Volatility Spike Exit:** Exit if the Bollinger Band width expands above its median historical value or a fixed threshold (e.g., 50th percentile).  
- **Profit Target:** Close the position if a fixed return (e.g., 5-10%) is achieved.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Use a trailing stop or volatility-based stop (e.g., exit if volatility rises beyond 1.5x the entry width).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the high leverage inherent in volatility products (e.g., risk ≤ 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid overlapping trades during prolonged low-volatility regimes.  
- Monitor macroeconomic events that could trigger unexpected volatility spikes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) + width calculation.  
2. Historical percentile ranking for Bollinger Band width.  
3. Volume-adjusted skew metric (e.g., rolling skewness of returns multiplied by volume Z-score).  
4. Volatility spike detection (e.g., Bollinger Band width expansion threshold).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines Bollinger Band contraction with skew-based sentiment analysis for high-probability short volatility setups.  
- Focuses on exploiting complacency rather than pure mean reversion or trend-following.  
- Exits are dynamic, blending profit targets and volatility regime shifts.  

**Note:** Backtest the skew metric’s predictive power for your asset class, as its effectiveness varies across markets.
