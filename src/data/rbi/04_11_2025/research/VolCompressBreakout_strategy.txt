STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility compression detection with volume confirmation and Ichimoku-based trend following for high-probability breakout trades.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Bollinger Band Width (BBW) contraction below historical percentile threshold
2. Volume Confirmation: Relative volume surge above normal levels
3. Breakout Trigger: First close outside Bollinger Bands
4. Trend Following Exit: Ichimoku Kijun-sen (base line) cross

Indicator Requirements:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band
3. Volume (compared to X-day average)
4. Ichimoku Cloud (specifically Kijun-sen line)

Entry Rules:
1. BBW must contract below its 20th percentile (or other optimized threshold) of historical values
2. Current volume must be > 1.5x the 20-day average volume
3. Price must close outside Bollinger Bands (upper for long, lower for short)
4. All conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Close below Kijun-sen line
2. For short positions: Close above Kijun-sen line
3. Optional: Time-based exit if no Kijun-sen cross occurs within X bars

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (ATR-based)
2. Initial stop loss:
   - Longs: Below recent swing low or below lower Bollinger Band
   - Shorts: Above recent swing high or above upper Bollinger Band
3. Trailing stop activates after price moves X% in favor
4. Maximum risk per trade (1-2% of capital)

Optimization Considerations:
1. BBW percentile threshold (15th-25th typically works well)
2. Volume multiplier (1.3x-2.0x range)
3. Bollinger Band parameters (20,2 is standard but can be tested)
4. Kijun-sen period (default 26 may need adjustment)

Strategy Advantages:
1. Captures explosive moves after low volatility periods
2. Volume confirmation filters false breakouts
3. Ichimoku exit keeps traders in strong trends
4. Works across multiple timeframes and instruments

Implementation Notes:
1. Requires historical BBW percentile calculation
2. Best combined with sector/market context
3. Performs well in trending markets, may struggle in choppy conditions
4. Backtest should include various volatility regimes
