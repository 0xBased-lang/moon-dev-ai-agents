STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Funding Rate Extremes:** Identifies overleveraged long positions by detecting when 24h funding rates exceed 3 standard deviations above their 30-day average.  
2. **Keltner Channel Break:** Confirms bearish momentum when price breaches the lower Keltner Channel (a volatility-based envelope).  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Automatically closes trades after 48 hours to limit exposure to prolonged adverse conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** 24h funding rate > 30-day average + (3 × standard deviation of funding rates).  
- **Condition 2:** Price closes below the lower Keltner Channel (typical settings: 20-period EMA, 2x ATR width).  
- **Execution:** Enter a short position on the perpetual futures contract once both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit/Target:** Close the trade if price retraces to the middle Keltner Channel (20-period EMA).  
- **Time Limit:** Exit automatically after 48 hours if not stopped out earlier.  
- **Stop-Loss (Optional):** Consider adding a stop above recent swing high or upper Keltner band for additional risk control.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for high volatility during funding rate extremes.  
- Avoid overlapping trades on correlated assets to prevent overexposure.  
- Monitor funding rate mean-reversion speed—extreme deviations may correct abruptly.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Funding Rate Data:** 24h funding rate history + 30-day rolling average and standard deviation.  
2. **Keltner Channels:** 20-period EMA with bands set at 2x ATR (14-period).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines quantitative crowding (funding rate extremes) with technical breakdowns (Keltner breach), targeting overextended longs while using volatility bands for exit timing.
