STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Liquidation Heatmap Analysis: Identifies high liquidation zones where price may experience accelerated moves due to stop-loss clustering
- Volatility Filter: Uses Bollinger Band Width to detect low volatility regimes (compression periods)
- Price Action Confirmation: Requires price to approach liquidation zones with specific momentum characteristics

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry:
  a) Bollinger Band Width reaches lower 20% of its 50-period range (low volatility)
  b) Price approaches a significant long liquidation zone (from heatmap data)
  c) Price shows upward momentum (e.g., 2 consecutive green candles closing above midpoint)

- Short Entry:
  a) Bollinger Band Width reaches lower 20% of its 50-period range (low volatility)
  b) Price approaches a significant short liquidation zone (from heatmap data)
  c) Price shows downward momentum (e.g., 2 consecutive red candles closing below midpoint)

3. Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: 
  a) Fixed RR ratio (e.g., 1:2)
  b) Or when reaching next significant liquidation cluster in opposite direction
- Stop Loss:
  a) Placed just beyond the liquidation zone that triggered the trade
  b) Alternative: 1.5x recent Average True Range

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on distance to stop loss (1-2% risk per trade)
- Maximum 3 concurrent trades
- Daily loss limit of 5% of account
- Avoid trading during major news events

5. Required Indicators:
- Liquidation Heatmap (cluster density visualization)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) with Width calculation
- Volume Profile (for additional confirmation)
- 50-period moving average (trend filter)

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H-4H timeframes
- Requires clean liquidity data feed
- Most effective in ranging markets with clear liquidity pools
- Combine with order flow analysis for higher probability entries

This strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency to hunt for liquidity during low volatility periods, using Bollinger Band compression as a volatility filter and liquidation clusters as key price targets. The unique combination of liquidity analysis with volatility measurement creates high-probability trade setups.
