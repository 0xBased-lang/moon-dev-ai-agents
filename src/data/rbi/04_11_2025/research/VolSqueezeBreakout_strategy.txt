STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by high-volume breakouts, using Bollinger Band width contraction as the primary signal.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (20-period) - Measures volatility contraction when at 20-day low
2. Volume Surge - Confirmation via volume exceeding 50-day average
3. Dynamic Exit - Based on 2x entry Bollinger Band width

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width (20,2) to reach its lowest point in 20 days (volatility contraction)
2. Confirm breakout with volume exceeding 50-day moving average
3. Enter long/short on first candle that closes outside the Bollinger Bands after contraction

Exit Rules:
1. Calculate Bollinger Band width at entry (Upper Band - Lower Band)
2. Set profit target at 2x the entry band width from entry price
3. Stop loss placed at opposite band (long trades: lower band, short trades: upper band)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on stop loss distance (1-2% risk per trade)
2. No trades during major economic news events (avoid false breakouts)
3. Maximum 5% portfolio exposure to single trade

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator (Upper-Lower)
3. Volume 50-day moving average

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different multiples for exit (1.5x-3x band width)
2. Consider adding ADX filter (>25) for stronger trends
3. Backtest different lookback periods for band width lows (15-30 days)

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending conditions, with the volume surge confirming genuine breakout potential rather than false moves.
