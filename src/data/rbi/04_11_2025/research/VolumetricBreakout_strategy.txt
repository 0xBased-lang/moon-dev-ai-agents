STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Volatility Breakout System - Uses Bollinger Bands to identify potential breakout opportunities
2. Volume Confirmation - Requires 2x average volume to validate the breakout
3. Momentum Exit - Uses RSI to determine when momentum is waning

Entry Rules:
1. Price must close above the upper Bollinger Band (20,2)
2. Volume must exceed 2x the 20-day average volume
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously on the same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When RSI(14) crosses below 70 from above
2. Optional Stop Loss: 2x ATR(14) below entry price for risk management

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume (20-day average)
3. RSI (14 periods)
4. ATR (14 periods) for optional stop loss

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on account risk tolerance (1-2% per trade recommended)
2. The optional ATR-based stop provides volatility-adjusted protection
3. Avoid trading during major news events when false breakouts are more likely

Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets with clear volatility expansion
- May generate false signals in ranging markets
- Volume confirmation helps filter out weak breakouts
- Consider testing different RSI thresholds (e.g., 60-75) for exit optimization
- Best applied to liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
