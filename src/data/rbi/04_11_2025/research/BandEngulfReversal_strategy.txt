STRATEGY_NAME: BandEngulfReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** – Identifies overbought/oversold conditions via price touching lower/upper bands.  
2. **Bullish Engulfing Candlestick** – Confirms reversal potential after a downtrend.  
3. **Volume Analysis** – Rising volume validates the strength of the reversal signal.  
4. **Risk-Reward Management** – Exits either at the upper Bollinger Band or a fixed 2:1 reward ratio.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Price touches or crosses the **lower Bollinger Band**.  
- **Condition 2:** A **bullish engulfing candlestick** forms immediately after.  
- **Condition 3:** Volume must be **rising** compared to recent average (e.g., 20-period SMA of volume).  
- **Entry Point:** Next candle open after confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target 1:** Upper Bollinger Band (dynamic exit).  
- **Profit Target 2:** 2:1 risk-reward ratio (e.g., if stop loss is 1%, take profit at 2%).  
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the engulfing candle or recent swing low.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low volatility (Bollinger Band squeeze).  
- Filter trades with higher timeframes (e.g., only long if daily trend is bullish).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 StdDev).  
2. Volume SMA (20-period).  
3. Candlestick pattern recognition (bullish engulfing).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines mean-reversion (Bollinger Bands) with momentum (engulfing + volume) for high-probability reversals.
