STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility dislocations in the S&P 500 by identifying specific conditions where the VIX futures become overpriced relative to realized volatility, combined with unusual trading volume activity.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Spread Analysis: Tracks the relationship between 20-day realized volatility and the VIX index
2. Volume Surge Detection: Identifies when trading volume exceeds normal levels by 50%
3. Mean Reversion Framework: Targets reversion to 1-year historical mean spreads

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 20-day realized volatility crosses BELOW the current VIX level
2. Confirmation Signal: Trading volume surges 50% above its 20-day average
3. Execution: Short VIX futures when both conditions are met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Target: Close position when the VIX-realized volatility spread reverts to its 1-year historical mean
2. Alternative Exit: Implement a trailing stop-loss at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of VIX futures

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Limit to 2-5% of portfolio per trade
2. Maximum Drawdown: Implement circuit breaker at 8% loss per position
3. Volatility Filter: Avoid trading when VIX is below 12 (low volatility regime)

Required Indicators:
1. 20-day realized volatility (calculated from SPX daily returns)
2. VIX index (current level)
3. 20-day average volume for VIX futures
4. 1-year historical mean of VIX-realized volatility spread
5. Average True Range (ATR) for stop-loss calculation

Additional Notes:
- Best performed during normal volatility regimes (VIX 12-25)
- Requires monitoring of macroeconomic events that might disrupt normal volatility patterns
- Backtesting should account for roll costs in VIX futures contracts
- Consider implementing as part of a broader volatility trading portfolio for diversification
