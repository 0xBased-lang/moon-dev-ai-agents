STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width (difference between upper and lower bands) on the 4-hour chart contracts below its 10-period moving average. This signals a potential breakout.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a surge in trading volume exceeding the 50-period median volume, ensuring the move has strong participation.  
3. **Keltner Channel Filter:** The 20-period Keltner Channel acts as a dynamic support/resistance level for trade exits, preventing false breakouts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a **long** position when:  
  1. Bollinger Band width is below its 10-period average (indicating contraction).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds the 50-period median.  
- Enter a **short** position when:  
  1. Bollinger Band width is below its 10-period average.  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds the 50-period median.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Close the trade at a 2:1 risk-reward ratio (e.g., if stop loss is 50 pips, take profit at 100 pips).  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - For longs: Exit if price closes below the lower Keltner Channel.  
  - For shorts: Exit if price closes above the upper Keltner Channel.  
- **Trailing Stop (Optional):** Adjust stop loss to breakeven once price reaches 1:1 risk-reward.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of the account balance.  
- Avoid trading during major economic news events to prevent false breakouts.  
- Only trade liquid assets with tight spreads to minimize slippage.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To measure volatility contraction and breakout levels.  
2. **Volume (50-period median)** – To confirm breakout strength.  
3. **Keltner Channel (20,1.5)** – For dynamic exit signals.  

**Unique Edge:**  
This strategy combines volatility contraction (Bollinger Band width), volume confirmation, and a secondary channel (Keltner) for filtering, reducing false signals common in pure breakout systems. The 2:1 reward ratio ensures positive expectancy over time.
