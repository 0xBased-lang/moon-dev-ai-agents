STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityReversal strategy is designed to capitalize on periods of low volatility followed by potential breakouts, using a combination of Bollinger Bands and RSI indicators. The strategy focuses on identifying contraction phases in the market and entering trades when conditions suggest a potential reversal or breakout.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands**: Used to measure volatility and identify contraction phases. The strategy looks for the narrowest Bollinger Band width in the last 30 days.
2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Used to identify oversold conditions and confirm potential reversals. The strategy requires RSI to be below 40 for entry and above 70 for exit.

### Entry Rules:
- **Condition 1**: Bollinger Bands must contract to their narrowest point in the last 30 days, indicating a period of low volatility.
- **Condition 2**: RSI must be below 40, signaling that the asset is oversold and potentially due for a reversal.
- **Action**: Enter a long position when both conditions are met.

### Exit Rules:
- **Exit Condition 1**: Price crosses the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential breakout or overbought condition.
- **Exit Condition 2**: RSI exceeds 70, signaling that the asset is overbought and may reverse.
- **Action**: Exit the long position when either condition is met.

### Risk Management:
- **Stop Loss**: Consider placing a stop loss below the lower Bollinger Band to protect against unexpected downside moves.
- **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your portfolio (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
- **Time-Based Exit**: If the trade does not trigger an exit condition within a predefined period (e.g., 5-10 days), consider closing the position to avoid prolonged exposure.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** (14-period)

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or range-bound markets where volatility cycles are predictable.
- Avoid using this strategy during highly volatile or news-driven market conditions, as false signals may occur.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to ensure its effectiveness for your chosen asset and timeframe.

By combining volatility contraction with oversold RSI conditions, the VolatilityReversal strategy aims to capture high-probability reversal or breakout opportunities while managing risk effectively.
