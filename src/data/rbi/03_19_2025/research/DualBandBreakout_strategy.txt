STRATEGY_NAME: DualBand Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DualBand Breakout strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines the Keltner Channel and Bollinger Band indicators to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The strategy focuses on periods of low volatility (squeeze) followed by a breakout with strong volume confirmation, providing a robust framework for capturing significant price movements.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Keltner Channel**: A volatility-based indicator that uses an exponential moving average (EMA) and average true range (ATR) to create upper and lower bands.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: A volatility indicator that uses a simple moving average (SMA) and standard deviations to create upper and lower bands.
3. **Volume Spike**: A significant increase in trading volume compared to recent averages, confirming the strength of the breakout.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Squeeze Condition**: Wait for both the Keltner Channel and Bollinger Bands to contract simultaneously, indicating a period of low volatility (squeeze).
2. **Breakout Confirmation**: Enter a trade when the price closes outside both the Keltner Channel and Bollinger Bands.
3. **Volume Confirmation**: Ensure the breakout is accompanied by a volume spike, indicating strong participation in the move.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Re-entry into Bands**: Exit the trade when the price re-enters either the Keltner Channel or Bollinger Bands, signaling a potential reversal or loss of momentum.
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss just outside the opposite band to limit potential losses.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your trading capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to manage risk.
2. **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss at a level that aligns with your risk tolerance, typically just outside the opposite band.
3. **Take Profit**: Consider using a trailing stop or a predefined profit target based on recent price action or volatility.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Keltner Channel**: Set with a 20-period EMA and 2x ATR multiplier.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: Set with a 20-period SMA and 2 standard deviations.
3. **Volume Indicator**: Use a volume oscillator or simple volume bars to identify spikes.

### Additional Notes:
- **Timeframe**: This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to filter out noise and false breakouts.
- **Market Conditions**: Ideal for trending markets or periods of consolidation followed by strong breakouts.
- **Confirmation**: Always wait for the close of the candle outside both bands to avoid false signals.

By combining the strengths of both Keltner Channels and Bollinger Bands, the DualBand Breakout strategy provides a robust framework for identifying and trading high-probability breakout opportunities with strong risk management.
