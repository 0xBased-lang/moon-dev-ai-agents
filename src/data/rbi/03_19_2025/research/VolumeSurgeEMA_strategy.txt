STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeSurgeEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumeSurgeEMA strategy combines trend-following principles with volume confirmation and momentum-based exits. It focuses on capturing strong trending moves initiated by high-volume breakouts while using RSI to identify overbought conditions for exits.

Key Components:
1. EMA Crossover: Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as the primary trend confirmation
2. Volume Spike: Requires a significant increase in volume to confirm the strength of the breakout
3. RSI Filter: Uses RSI as an exit signal when momentum starts to wane
4. Risk Management: Implements a 2:1 risk-reward ratio for position sizing

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross above the 200-period EMA
2. Confirm the crossover with a volume spike (minimum 2x average volume of last 20 periods)
3. Enter long position at the next candle's open after confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When RSI crosses below 70 from above
2. Secondary Exit: If price reaches 2x the initial risk level (2:1 reward target)
3. Stop Loss: Place stop loss at the most recent swing low before entry

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Calculate position size based on 1-2% of account risk per trade
2. Stop Loss: Set at the most recent swing low before entry
3. Reward Target: Set at 2x the distance between entry and stop loss
4. Maximum Drawdown: Limit to 5% of account equity

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period default)
4. Volume Indicator (with 20-period average volume line)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for trending markets and higher timeframes (1H or above)
- Volume spike confirmation helps filter out false breakouts
- RSI exit helps capture profits before potential reversals
- Consider adding a time-based exit if price stagnates without reaching target
- Backtest thoroughly to determine optimal volume spike threshold for your market
