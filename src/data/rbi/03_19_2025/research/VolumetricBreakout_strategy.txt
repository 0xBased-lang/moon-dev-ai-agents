STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricBreakout strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that combines Bollinger Bands with volume analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The strategy focuses on capturing momentum during periods of increased volatility while using volume as a confirmation tool.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume indicator
3. Risk-reward ratio management (2:1)

Entry Rules:
- Long Entry: Trigger when price closes above the upper Bollinger Band AND volume is increasing compared to the previous period.
- Short Entry: Trigger when price closes below the lower Bollinger Band AND volume is decreasing compared to the previous period.

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: Set at 2x the initial risk (distance from entry to stop-loss)
- Stop Loss: Place at the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
- Time Exit: Close position if target not reached within 5 periods

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new trades if 3 consecutive losses occur
4. Stop-loss automatically adjusts to breakeven once price moves 1x risk in favorable direction

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume indicator (standard volume bars or OBV)
3. Simple Moving Average (20-period for middle band)

Additional Considerations:
- Best suited for 15-minute to 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets, less effective in ranging conditions
- Volume confirmation helps filter false breakouts
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher timeframes
- Avoid trading during low liquidity periods

Optimization Tips:
- Test different Bollinger Band periods (14-26) for specific instruments
- Experiment with volume thresholds (e.g., 20% increase/decrease)
- Consider adding a momentum filter (e.g., RSI above/below 50)
- Backtest across multiple market conditions for robustness

This strategy combines the reliability of Bollinger Bands with the confirmation power of volume analysis, creating a systematic approach to volatility breakouts while maintaining strict risk management protocols.
