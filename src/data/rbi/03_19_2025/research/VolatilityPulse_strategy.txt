STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityPulse strategy is designed to capitalize on periods of low volatility followed by explosive price movements. It combines Bollinger Bands and volume analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
   - Volume analysis (20-day average volume)
   - Volatility contraction detection (30-day narrowest Bollinger Band width)

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - Monitor Bollinger Band width daily
   - Identify when the bands reach their narrowest point in the last 30 days
   - Wait for price to break above the upper band or below the lower band
   - Confirm breakout with volume exceeding the 20-day average volume
   - Enter long position on upper band breakout with volume confirmation
   - Enter short position on lower band breakout with volume confirmation

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - For long positions: Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands
   - For short positions: Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands
   - Alternatively, set a trailing stop at the opposite band level
   - Consider taking partial profits at 1x ATR (Average True Range) from entry point

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
   - Initial stop-loss placed at the opposite band level
   - Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account
   - Maximum weekly loss limit of 10% of account
   - Avoid trading during major news events or holidays

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2)
   - Volume indicator with 20-day average
   - ATR (14) for profit target calculation
   - Optional: RSI (14) for additional confirmation (avoid overbought/oversold conditions)

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Best suited for 4-hour or daily charts
   - Works well in trending markets
   - Less effective in choppy or sideways markets
   - Combine with fundamental analysis for higher timeframes
   - Backtest on multiple instruments to find best-performing assets

7. **Optimization Tips**:
   - Adjust Bollinger Band period and standard deviations based on asset volatility
   - Experiment with different volume confirmation thresholds
   - Consider adding a momentum filter (e.g., MACD) to avoid false breakouts
   - Test different timeframes for various trading styles (intraday vs. swing trading)

This strategy requires patience as it waits for high-probability setups, but can yield significant returns when volatility expands after contraction periods. Always paper trade and backtest thoroughly before live implementation.
