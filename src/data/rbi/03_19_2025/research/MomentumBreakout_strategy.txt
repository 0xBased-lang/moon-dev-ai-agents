STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumBreakout strategy is designed to capitalize on strong trending markets by combining moving average crossovers, trend strength confirmation, and volatility-based exits. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Key Components:
1. **Trend Identification (EMA Crossover)**:
   - Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA to identify a bullish trend.
   - This crossover signals a potential shift in market momentum.

2. **Trend Strength Confirmation (ADX)**:
   - Requires the ADX (Average Directional Index) to rise above 25 to confirm the strength of the trend.
   - This ensures the strategy only trades in markets with strong directional momentum.

3. **Volatility-Based Stop-Loss (ATR)**:
   - Uses a 2x ATR (Average True Range) stop-loss to manage risk dynamically based on market volatility.
   - This adapts to changing market conditions and protects against excessive losses.

4. **Overbought/Oversold Exit (RSI)**:
   - Exits trades when the 5-period RSI crosses above 70 (overbought) or below 30 (oversold).
   - This helps capture profits before potential reversals.

### Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross above the 200-period EMA (bullish crossover).
2. Confirm the trend strength by ensuring the ADX is above 25 and rising.
3. Enter a long position on the next candle after both conditions are met.

---

### Exit Rules:
1. **Stop-Loss Exit**:
   - Place a stop-loss at 2x the current ATR value below the entry price.
   - This ensures risk is proportional to market volatility.

2. **RSI Exit**:
   - Exit the trade if the 5-period RSI crosses above 70 (overbought) or below 30 (oversold).
   - This captures profits during extreme price movements.

---

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Use a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
2. **Stop-Loss**:
   - The 2x ATR stop-loss ensures risk is adjusted for current market volatility.
3. **Avoid Overtrading**:
   - Only trade when both the EMA crossover and ADX conditions are met.

---

### Required Indicators:
1. **50-period EMA** (Exponential Moving Average):
   - Identifies short-term momentum.
2. **200-period EMA**:
   - Identifies long-term trend direction.
3. **ADX (Average Directional Index)**:
   - Confirms trend strength.
4. **ATR (Average True Range)**:
   - Sets dynamic stop-loss levels.
5. **5-period RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
   - Identifies overbought/oversold conditions for exits.

---

### Example Trade:
1. **Setup**:
   - 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA.
   - ADX rises above 25.
2. **Entry**:
   - Buy on the next candle after the crossover and ADX confirmation.
3. **Stop-Loss**:
   - Set at 2x ATR below the entry price.
4. **Exit**:
   - Close the trade if RSI crosses above 70 or below 30, or if the stop-loss is hit.

This strategy is ideal for trending markets and avoids choppy or sideways conditions by relying on the ADX filter. The combination of EMA crossovers, trend strength confirmation, and volatility-based exits makes it a robust approach for capturing sustained price movements.
