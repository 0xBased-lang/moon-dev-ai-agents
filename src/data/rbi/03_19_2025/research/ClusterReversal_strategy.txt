STRATEGY_NAME: ClusterReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ClusterReversal strategy is a sophisticated counter-trend trading approach that leverages high-density liquidation clusters from order book data, combined with Heikin-Ashi candlestick patterns and volatility analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **High-Density Liquidation Clusters**: 
   - Identify areas in the order book where a high concentration of stop-loss orders or liquidation levels are clustered.
   - These clusters often act as reversal zones as price approaches them, triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders that can reverse the trend.

2. **Heikin-Ashi Candlestick Patterns**:
   - Use the 4-hour Heikin-Ashi chart to smooth out price action and identify trend reversals.
   - Look for a "flip" in the Heikin-Ashi candlestick pattern, where the color changes (e.g., from green to red or red to green), signaling a potential reversal.

3. **Volatility Filter**:
   - Only take trades when volatility is below average, as this indicates a potential buildup of energy for a reversal.
   - Use a volatility indicator like ATR (Average True Range) to confirm below-average volatility conditions.

4. **Swing Extremes for Stop-Loss**:
   - Set stop-losses at recent swing highs or lows, depending on the direction of the trade.
   - This ensures risk is managed effectively while allowing room for the trade to develop.

### **Entry Rules**
1. **Identify Liquidation Clusters**:
   - Use order book data to locate high-density liquidation zones.
   - These zones should align with key support or resistance levels.

2. **Confirm Heikin-Ashi Flip**:
   - Wait for the 4-hour Heikin-Ashi candlestick to flip color (e.g., from bullish to bearish or vice versa) near the liquidation cluster.

3. **Check Volatility**:
   - Ensure that volatility is below average using an ATR indicator or similar tool.

4. **Enter the Trade**:
   - Enter a counter-trend position (e.g., short near a resistance liquidation cluster or long near a support liquidation cluster) when all conditions align.

### **Exit Rules**
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set take-profit levels at the next significant support or resistance level, or use a risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).

2. **Stop-Loss**:
   - Place stop-losses at recent swing extremes (e.g., above the recent swing high for a short trade or below the recent swing low for a long trade).

3. **Trailing Stop**:
   - Optionally, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

---

### **Risk Management**
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance to your stop-loss level.

2. **Volatility Filter**:
   - Avoid trading during high volatility periods to reduce the risk of false signals.

3. **Stop-Loss Discipline**:
   - Always adhere to your stop-loss levels to protect your capital.

### **Required Indicators**
1. **Order Book Data**:
   - Access to real-time order book data to identify liquidation clusters.

2. **Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks**:
   - Use a 4-hour Heikin-Ashi chart to identify trend reversals.

3. **Volatility Indicator**:
   - Use ATR or another volatility indicator to confirm below-average volatility conditions.

4. **Swing High/Low Tool**:
   - Identify recent swing extremes for stop-loss placement.
