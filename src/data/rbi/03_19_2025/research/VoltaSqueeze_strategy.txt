STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

The VoltaSqueeze strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by potential breakouts. It combines Bollinger Bands and volume analysis to identify high-probability entry and exit points. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
   - Volume analysis (20-day average volume)
   - Volatility squeeze detection (narrowest Bollinger Band width in 30 days)

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract to their narrowest width in the last 30 days, indicating a volatility squeeze.
   - Enter a long position when:
     - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band
     - Volume on the breakout candle exceeds the 20-day average volume
   - Enter a short position when:
     - Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band
     - Volume on the breakout candle exceeds the 20-day average volume

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - For long positions:
     - Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands
     - Or when price touches the opposite (lower) Bollinger Band
   - For short positions:
     - Exit when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands
     - Or when price touches the opposite (upper) Bollinger Band

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Set stop-loss at 1.5 times the average true range (ATR) from entry point
   - Position size should be calculated based on 1% risk per trade
   - Maximum daily loss limit of 3% of account equity
   - Use trailing stops to lock in profits during strong trends

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2)
   - Volume indicator with 20-day average
   - Average True Range (ATR) for stop-loss calculation
   - Custom script to detect narrowest Bollinger Band width in 30 days

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Best applied on liquid assets with consistent volatility patterns
   - Works well on daily and 4-hour timeframes
   - Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups
   - Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts

This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets and can be adapted to various asset classes. The combination of volatility contraction, breakout confirmation, and volume validation creates a robust framework for identifying high-probability trading opportunities.
