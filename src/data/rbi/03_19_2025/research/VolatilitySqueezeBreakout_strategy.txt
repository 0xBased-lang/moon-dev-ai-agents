STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilitySqueezeBreakout strategy is designed to capitalize on periods of low volatility followed by high-probability breakouts. It combines Bollinger Bands and volume analysis to identify potential trading opportunities.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume analysis (20-day average volume)
3. Volatility contraction detection (30-day narrowest band width)

Entry Rules:
1. Monitor Bollinger Bands for contraction
2. Identify when the band width reaches its narrowest point in the last 30 days
3. Wait for price to break above the upper band (for long) or below the lower band (for short)
4. Confirm breakout with volume exceeding the 20-day average volume
5. Enter trade in the direction of the breakout

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions:
   - Exit when price closes below the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
   - Or when price retraces to the breakout level (upper band)
2. For short positions:
   - Exit when price closes above the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
   - Or when price retraces to the breakout level (lower band)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk tolerance (1-2% per trade recommended)
2. Stop-loss placement:
   - For long positions: below the lower Bollinger Band
   - For short positions: above the upper Bollinger Band
3. Consider using a trailing stop based on the middle band after initial breakout
4. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume indicator
3. 20-day average volume calculation
4. Band width measurement tool

Additional Considerations:
1. Backtest the strategy on your chosen timeframe
2. Adjust parameters based on market conditions and asset volatility
3. Combine with other confirmation indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for higher probability setups
4. Monitor multiple timeframes for confluence
5. Maintain a trading journal to track performance and refine the strategy

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals during prolonged consolidation periods. Proper risk management and patience are crucial for long-term success.
