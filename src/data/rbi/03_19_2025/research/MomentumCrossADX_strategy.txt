STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumCrossADX

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumCrossADX strategy combines trend-following and momentum confirmation to identify high-probability long entries. It uses the EMA crossover as a primary trend signal, the ADX for trend strength confirmation, and the RSI for overbought conditions to manage exits.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **50-period EMA**: Short-term exponential moving average to capture recent price momentum.
2. **200-period EMA**: Long-term exponential moving average to identify the overall trend direction.
3. **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: Measures the strength of the trend. A rising ADX above 25 confirms a strong trend.
4. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Identifies overbought conditions to signal potential exits.

### Entry Rules:
1. **EMA Crossover**: Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross above the 200-period EMA, indicating a bullish trend shift.
2. **ADX Confirmation**: Ensure the ADX is rising and above 25, confirming strong trend momentum.
3. **Entry Signal**: Enter a long position when both conditions are met.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Overbought RSI**: Exit the trade when the RSI exceeds 70, signaling overbought conditions and potential price reversal.
2. **Weak Trend**: Exit the trade when the ADX drops below 20, indicating a weakening trend.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage below the entry price (e.g., 1-2%).
2. **Position Sizing**: Use a consistent risk-per-trade percentage (e.g., 1-2% of account equity).
3. **Trailing Stop**: Consider using a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trend progresses.

### Required Indicators:
1. **50-period EMA**
2. **200-period EMA**
3. **ADX (14-period default)**
4. **RSI (14-period default)**

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets. Avoid using it during choppy or sideways market conditions.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to identify optimal settings for your trading style.
- Combine with fundamental analysis or other technical tools for additional confirmation if needed.
