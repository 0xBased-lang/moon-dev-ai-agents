STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityLiquidity

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityLiquidity strategy is designed to capitalize on breakouts during low-liquidity hours, using a combination of volatility-adjusted Donchian Channels and tick volume momentum divergence for confirmation. This strategy is particularly effective in markets where liquidity drops significantly during certain hours, leading to more pronounced price movements.

Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volatility-Adjusted Donchian Channel**: This indicator adjusts the traditional Donchian Channel based on market volatility, providing dynamic support and resistance levels that are more responsive to current market conditions.
2. **Tick Volume Momentum Divergence**: This component analyzes the relationship between tick volume and price movement. A divergence occurs when price moves in one direction while tick volume moves in the opposite direction, signaling potential reversals or continuations.
3. **Low-Liquidity Hours**: The strategy focuses on trading during specific hours when market liquidity is lower, which can lead to more significant price movements and breakouts.

Entry Rules:
1. **Breakout Confirmation**: Enter a trade when the price exceeds the upper or lower bound of the volatility-adjusted Donchian Channel.
2. **Divergence Confirmation**: Ensure that there is a divergence between tick volume momentum and price movement. For example, if the price breaks above the Donchian Channel upper bound, tick volume should be decreasing, indicating a potential continuation of the breakout.

Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Set a profit target based on a multiple of the average true range (ATR) or a fixed percentage of the entry price.
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss just below the Donchian Channel bound that was breached for long positions, or above the bound for short positions.
3. **Time-Based Exit**: Exit the trade if the price does not move in the expected direction within a specified time frame, such as the end of the low-liquidity trading session.

Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of the trading capital for each trade, typically between 1-2%, to manage risk.
2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2, ensuring that potential profits outweigh potential losses.
3. **Diversification**: Avoid concentrating all trades in a single asset or market to spread risk.

Required Indicators:
1. **Volatility-Adjusted Donchian Channel**: Custom indicator that adjusts the Donchian Channel based on market volatility.
2. **Tick Volume Momentum**: Indicator that measures the momentum of tick volume and compares it to price movement.
3. **Average True Range (ATR)**: Used to set profit targets and stop-loss levels based on market volatility.
4. **Time-Based Filters**: Tools to identify and trade only during low-liquidity hours.

By combining these elements, the VolatilityLiquidity strategy aims to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during periods of reduced market activity, leveraging the increased potential for significant price movements.
