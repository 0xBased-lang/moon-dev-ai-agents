STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The LiquidationSqueeze strategy is designed to capitalize on short-term bearish momentum by identifying key liquidation zones, Bollinger Band squeeze breakdowns, and negative funding rate surges. This strategy is particularly effective in volatile markets where liquidity-driven moves are prevalent.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Clustered Liquidation Zones**: Identify areas where a high concentration of stop-loss orders (liquidation zones) are likely to trigger. These zones are typically found near significant support/resistance levels or high-volume nodes.
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Breakdown**: Use Bollinger Bands to detect periods of low volatility (squeeze) followed by a breakdown, indicating a potential breakout in price.
3. **Negative Funding Rates**: Confirm bearish sentiment with a surge in negative funding rates, which indicates that short positions are being heavily funded.
4. **High-Volume Nodes**: Use volume profile analysis to identify significant high-volume nodes, which act as key support/resistance levels.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Liquidation Zone Alignment**: Wait for price to approach a clustered liquidation zone.
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Breakdown**: Confirm a breakdown from a Bollinger Band squeeze (price breaking below the lower band).
3. **Negative Funding Rate Surge**: Ensure there is a significant surge in negative funding rates, confirming bearish sentiment.
4. **Entry Signal**: Enter a short position when all three conditions align.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Retest of High-Volume Node**: Exit the short position when price retests the nearest high-volume node, which acts as a resistance level.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Place a stop-loss just above the recent swing high or above the upper Bollinger Band to limit potential losses.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of your trading capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Always use a stop-loss to protect against unexpected reversals.
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2, ensuring that potential profits outweigh potential losses.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands**: To identify periods of low volatility (squeeze) and potential breakdowns.
2. **Volume Profile**: To identify high-volume nodes and liquidation zones.
3. **Funding Rate Indicator**: To monitor funding rates and confirm bearish sentiment.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Timeframe**: This strategy works best on lower timeframes (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute) where liquidity-driven moves are more frequent.
- **Market Conditions**: Ideal for highly volatile markets with clear trends or breakouts.
- **Confirmation**: Always wait for confirmation from all three components (liquidation zone, Bollinger Band breakdown, and funding rate surge) before entering a trade.

By following the LiquidationSqueeze strategy, traders can effectively capitalize on short-term bearish momentum while managing risk through clear entry and exit rules.
