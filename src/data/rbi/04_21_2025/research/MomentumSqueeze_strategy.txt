STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Fisher Transform Crossover:** The Fisher Transform is used to identify potential reversals in price momentum. A bullish signal occurs when the Fisher Transform crosses above its signal line.  
2. **Volume Uptrend:** Confirmation of momentum is required via a 3-day increasing volume trend, ensuring participation in the move.  
3. **Bollinger Bandwidth Squeeze:** Narrowing Bollinger Bandwidth indicates low volatility and a potential breakout, adding confluence to the entry signal.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  1. The Fisher Transform crosses above its signal line (bullish momentum).  
  2. Volume has been increasing for at least 3 consecutive days (confirmation of interest).  
  3. Bollinger Bandwidth is narrowing (indicating a squeeze and potential breakout).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the long position when:  
  1. The Fisher Transform crosses below its signal line (momentum reversal).  
  2. Bollinger Bandwidth expands significantly (volatility breakout, suggesting exhaustion).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a trailing stop or fixed percentage stop (e.g., 2-3% below entry) to protect gains and limit losses.  
- Avoid entering if broader market conditions are bearish or if volume is declining despite the Fisher signal.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Fisher Transform** (with its signal line, typically a 9-period EMA of the Fisher).  
2. **Volume** (to confirm the 3-day uptrend).  
3. **Bollinger Bands** (to monitor Bandwidth contraction/expansion).  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets but may produce false signals in choppy conditions.  
- Combining with a higher timeframe trend filter (e.g., 200-day MA) can improve reliability.  
- Adjust the Fisher and Bollinger Band parameters based on asset volatility (e.g., shorter periods for crypto, longer for stocks).  

The name "MomentumSqueeze" reflects the strategyâ€™s focus on momentum (Fisher Transform) combined with volatility contraction (Bollinger Bandwidth squeeze).
