STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicSqueeze strategy capitalizes on volatility contractions followed by explosive breakouts, combining VWAP and Bollinger Bands with volume confirmation for high-probability trades.

Key Components:
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) - Serves as the mean-reversion anchor
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies volatility contractions
3. Volume Surge Filter - Requires 150% of 20-period average volume
4. Price Action - Breakout confirmation through band penetration

Entry Rules:
1. Setup Condition: 
   - Bollinger Band width contracts to bottom 20% of its 50-period range
   - Price consolidates near VWAP for at least 5 candles

2. Long Entry:
   - Price closes above upper Bollinger Band
   - Volume exceeds 1.5x 20-period average
   - Enter on next candle's open

3. Short Entry:
   - Price closes below lower Bollinger Band
   - Volume exceeds 1.5x 20-period average
   - Enter on next candle's open

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target:
   - Primary: 1.5x Bollinger Band width from entry point
   - Secondary: Previous swing high/low (for trend continuation)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Fixed: Opposite Bollinger Band (for mean reversion)
   - Trailing: VWAP (for trend following)

3. Mandatory Exit:
   - Price crosses back to VWAP with declining volume
   - Bollinger Band width expands beyond 80% of 50-period range

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum Daily Trades: 3 (to avoid overtrading contractions)
3. Time Filter: Only trade first 4 hours of session (highest liquidity)
4. Sector Correlation: Avoid simultaneous trades in correlated assets

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP (standard settings)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
3. Volume (with 20-period MA)
4. Bollinger Band Width Indicator

Optimization Notes:
- Best performance on 15m-1h timeframes
- Works well with liquid stocks/indices (SPY, QQQ, ES futures)
- Requires minimum $0.50 average true range for adequate movement
- Filter for stocks with average daily volume >1M shares

The VoltaicSqueeze excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the VWAP/Bollinger relationship to identify high-probability breakouts with volume confirmation while maintaining strict mean-reversion exits.
