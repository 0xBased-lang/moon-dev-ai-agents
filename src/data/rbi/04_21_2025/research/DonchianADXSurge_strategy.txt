STRATEGY_NAME: DonchianADX Surge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a momentum-based breakout strategy that combines Donchian Channel dynamics with ADX strength confirmation, designed to capture strong trending moves with disciplined risk management.

Key Components:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period) - Identifies breakout levels
2. ADX (5-period) - Confirms trend strength
3. Fixed 2:1 Risk-Reward Ratio - Ensures disciplined profit-taking

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry Trigger: When price closes ABOVE the upper Donchian Channel (20-period high)
2. Short Entry Trigger: When price closes BELOW the lower Donchian Channel (20-period low)
3. ADX Confirmation: The 5-period ADX must be >25 at time of breakout
4. Entry Execution: Enter on next candle's open after breakout confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Stop Loss Placement:
   - For long positions: Below the breakout candle's low
   - For short positions: Above the breakout candle's high
2. Take Profit Target: Set at 2x the distance between entry and stop loss
3. Optional Trailing Stop: May trail stop to breakeven after price moves 1x risk distance

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Calculate based on stop loss distance and account risk tolerance (typically 1-2% per trade)
2. Maximum Risk: Never risk more than 5% of account on concurrent trades
3. Trade Filter: Only take trades with ADX confirmation (must be >25)

Required Indicators:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period)
2. ADX (5-period with +DI/-DI disabled)
3. Price Action Analysis (for identifying breakout candles)

Special Considerations:
1. Best suited for 1-hour charts or higher timeframes
2. Most effective in trending markets (avoid ranging conditions)
3. Works well with liquid instruments (forex majors, large cap stocks, indices)
4. Requires patience as ADX >25 filter may reduce trade frequency

Optimization Notes:
1. May test different Donchian periods (15-30) based on instrument volatility
2. ADX period can be adjusted between 5-10 for different sensitivity
3. Risk-reward can be modified to 1.5:1 or 3:1 based on backtesting results

This strategy combines the reliability of channel breakouts with the momentum confirmation of ADX, while enforcing strict risk management through its fixed reward ratio approach.
