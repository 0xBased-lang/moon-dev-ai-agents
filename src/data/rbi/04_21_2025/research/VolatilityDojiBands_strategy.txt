STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDojiBands

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines multiple technical indicators to identify low-volatility compression periods and trade the subsequent breakout with volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candles (4H): Used to identify indecision periods through consecutive doji formations
2. Bollinger Bands (1st percentile width): Measures extreme contraction in volatility
3. Keltner Channels: Provides dynamic breakout levels
4. Volume Spikes (15m): Confirms breakout validity with 200% surge above 20-period average

Entry Rules:
- Trigger: 3+ consecutive doji candles on 4H Heikin-Ashi chart
- Confirmation: Bollinger Band width in 1st percentile of historical range
- Execution: Enter long volatility position at market when conditions met

Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: 2% price breach beyond Keltner Channel boundaries
- Volume Confirmation: 15-minute volume must spike >200% of 20-period average
- Stop Loss: 1.5x the Bollinger Band width at entry

Risk Management:
- Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum Drawdown: 5% of account per day
- Time Filter: Avoid trading during major economic news events
- Correlation Check: Ensure no overlapping volatility positions

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (4H timeframe)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 settings) with width percentile calculation
3. Keltner Channels (20,1.5 settings)
4. Volume indicator with 20-period MA (15m timeframe)

Special Notes:
- Works best in currency markets and commodities
- Requires monitoring multiple timeframes (4H for setup, 15m for exits)
- Most effective during Asian/London session overlaps
- Backtest suggested for optimal Bollinger Band width threshold adjustment
