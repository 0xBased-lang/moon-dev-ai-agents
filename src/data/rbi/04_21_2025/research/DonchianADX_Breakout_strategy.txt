STRATEGY_NAME: DonchianADX_Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Donchian Channel breakout signals with ADX trend strength confirmation for high-probability trades. The system waits for strong trending conditions before entering breakout trades, then uses a disciplined risk-reward approach for exits.

Key Components:
1. Donchian Channel (50-period) - Identifies breakout levels
2. ADX (14-period) - Confirms trend strength
3. Fixed 2:1 Risk-Reward Ratio - Ensures profitable exits

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price closes ABOVE the upper Donchian Channel (50-period high)
   - ADX(14) is above 25 and rising
   - Stop loss placed at the lower Donchian Channel (50-period low)

2. Short Entry:
   - Price closes BELOW the lower Donchian Channel (50-period low)
   - ADX(14) is above 25 and rising
   - Stop loss placed at the upper Donchian Channel (50-period high)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target:
   - Set at 2x the distance between entry and stop loss
   - For longs: Entry + (2 × (Entry - Stop))
   - For shorts: Entry - (2 × (Stop - Entry))

2. Stop Loss:
   - Always remains at original Donchian Channel level
   - Only moved to breakeven after price reaches 1x risk (not required but optional)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. No entries when ADX is below 25 (avoiding weak trends)
3. Stop loss always in place
4. No re-entries on same breakout (prevents overtrading)

Required Indicators:
1. Donchian Channel (50-period)
   - Upper Band: 50-period high
   - Lower Band: 50-period low
2. ADX (14-period)
   - Must be above 25 and rising for valid signals

Optimization Notes:
- Can test different Donchian periods (e.g., 30-70)
- May adjust ADX threshold (20-30 range)
- Could add filter like minimum breakout candle size

This strategy works best in trending markets and should be avoided during ranging conditions (when ADX is below 25). The 2:1 reward ratio ensures profitability even with 50% win rate.
