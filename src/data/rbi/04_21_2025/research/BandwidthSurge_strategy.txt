STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width reaches a 6-month low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** Requires volume to surge above the 20-day SMA to validate the breakout, ensuring strong participation.  
3. **Breakout Entry:** Enters trades when price breaks out of the contracted Bollinger Bands with high volume.  
4. **Exit Rules:** Uses a double candle retracement (two consecutive opposing candles) or a fixed 1.5x ATR profit target to lock in gains.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Wait for Bollinger Band width to reach a 6-month low (indicating extreme contraction).  
- Confirm volume surges above the 20-day SMA.  
- Enter long on a bullish breakout above the upper Bollinger Band or short on a bearish breakout below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit at 1.5x the current ATR (Average True Range) from the entry point.  
- **Retracement Stop:** Exit if two consecutive opposing candles (e.g., two bearish candles after a long entry) form.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a stop-loss at 1x ATR from entry to limit downside risk.  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods.  
- Position sizing should align with volatility (e.g., larger positions in low-ATR setups, smaller in high-ATR).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To measure contraction and breakout levels.  
2. **Volume 20-day SMA** – To confirm volume surge.  
3. **ATR (14-period)** – For profit target and stop-loss placement.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation.  
- Avoid using in choppy or sideways conditions (verify with ADX > 25 for trend strength).  
- Backtest for optimal ATR multiplier (1.5x is a starting point).  

This strategy combines low-volatility setups with volume confirmation for high-probability breakouts, while using ATR for dynamic risk/reward management.
