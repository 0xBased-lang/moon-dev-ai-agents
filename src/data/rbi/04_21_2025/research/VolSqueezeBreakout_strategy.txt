STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the 20-period Bollinger Band width contracts to its lowest level in the last 3 months, signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a surge in trading volume exceeding twice the 30-day average volume, confirming strong participation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. The 20-period Bollinger Band width must reach its lowest level in the last 3 months (indicating a volatility squeeze).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume on the breakout candle must be at least 2x the 30-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. The 20-period Bollinger Band width must reach its lowest level in the last 3 months.  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume on the breakout candle must be at least 2x the 30-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Set a take-profit target at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width at the time of entry (measured from the breakout point).  
- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Place a stop-loss at the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) for long trades.  
  - For short trades, place the stop-loss at the middle Bollinger Band.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.  
- Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop-loss levels to maintain consistent risk exposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)** – To identify volatility contraction and breakout levels.  
2. **Volume Indicator** – To confirm breakout validity with a surge in trading activity.  
3. **Average Volume (30-day)** – Used as a benchmark to measure volume surge.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Avoid trading during major news events unless the breakout is exceptionally strong.  
- Backtest across multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to confirm robustness.  

The **VolSqueezeBreakout** strategy capitalizes on low-volatility environments followed by high-momentum breakouts, ensuring high-probability trades with strong confirmation signals.
