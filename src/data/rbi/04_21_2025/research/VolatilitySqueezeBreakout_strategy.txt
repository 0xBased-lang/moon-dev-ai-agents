STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume analysis, and institutional confirmation to trade high-probability breakouts from consolidation zones.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channel Contraction: Uses narrowing Keltner Channels (20-period EMA with 2.5x ATR bands) to identify volatility squeeze conditions
2. Volume Decline: Requires declining volume during the consolidation period
3. Range Breakout: Entry triggered by price closing outside the 20-period price range
4. Open Interest Confirmation: Requires surge in futures open interest (>15% increase) to confirm institutional participation

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
1. Keltner Channel width must be in bottom 30% of 50-period range (volatility squeeze)
2. Volume must show declining trend over past 5 periods
3. Price closes above highest high of past 20 periods
4. Futures open interest shows significant increase (minimum 15% rise)

SHORT ENTRY:
1. Keltner Channel width must be in bottom 30% of 50-period range
2. Volume must show declining trend over past 5 periods
3. Price closes below lowest low of past 20 periods
4. Futures open interest shows significant increase (minimum 15% rise)

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: 2x ATR (20-period) from entry price
- Stop Loss: 1x ATR (20-period) from entry price
- Time Exit: Close position if not profitable after 5 periods

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No trading during major economic news events
4. Stop loss must be placed immediately after entry

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2.5x ATR bands)
2. Volume indicator (preferably volume MA)
3. 20-period price range high/low
4. Futures open interest data
5. ATR (20-period) for risk calculation

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Most effective in trending market conditions
- Requires access to reliable futures open interest data
- Backtesting suggested for specific instruments as performance varies by market liquidity
