STRATEGY_NAME: VolSpikeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme volatility events by combining VIX term structure analysis with VVIX Bollinger Band breakouts, targeting mean reversion opportunities with volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. VIX Term Structure Inversion: Requires front-month VIX futures to trade at a premium to second-month (contango to backwardation shift)
2. VVIX Spike: VVIX (VIX of VIX) must break above its upper 20-day Bollinger Band (typically set at 2 standard deviations)
3. Volume Confirmation: Requires above-average volume on the exit signal

Entry Rules:
- SHORT volatility when:
  1. VIX term structure inverts (front-month > second-month)
  2. VVIX closes above its upper 20-day Bollinger Band
  3. Confirm with elevated VIX futures volume (at least 20% above 20-day average)

Exit Rules:
- COVER short position when:
  1. VVIX reverts below its 20-day moving average
  2. VIX term structure returns to contango (front-month < second-month)
  3. Accompanied by volume at least 10% above 20-day average

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Allocate no more than 2-5% of capital per trade
2. Stop-loss: Exit if VVIX makes new 5-day high after entry
3. Time stop: Close position after 5 trading days if no exit signal occurs
4. Correlation check: Avoid entering if SPX is making new 20-day lows

Required Indicators:
1. VIX futures term structure (front-month vs second-month)
2. VVIX (VIX of VIX) with:
   - 20-day simple moving average
   - 20-day Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations)
3. Volume indicators for:
   - VIX futures
   - SPX options (for confirmation)

Additional Notes:
- Best executed during periods of market stress when volatility spikes are likely to mean-revert
- Most effective when combined with overbought technical conditions in SPX
- Requires monitoring of macroeconomic catalysts that could prolong volatility spikes
- Consider using VIX futures or short-dated SPX options for implementation
