STRATEGY_NAME: BandSurge Momentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a momentum-based breakout strategy that combines Bollinger Band volatility with ADX trend strength confirmation and RSI-based exit signals. The strategy capitalizes on strong trending moves while filtering out false breakouts.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) - Identifies volatility expansion
2. ADX (14-period) - Confirms trend strength
3. RSI (2-period) - Provides overbought exit signals

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Price must close above the upper Bollinger Band
2. Confirmation: ADX must be rising and cross above 25 on the same bar
3. Entry Execution: Enter long at market on next open after conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: Exit when 2-period RSI crosses below 70
2. Stop Loss: Optional trailing stop can be set at the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on volatility (consider using ATR for sizing)
2. Maximum risk per trade typically 1-2% of capital
3. Avoid trading during low ADX periods (<25) to prevent false breakouts
4. Consider implementing a time-based exit if RSI doesn't trigger (e.g., 5-10 bars)

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 periods, 2 standard deviations
- ADX: 14 periods (standard setting)
- RSI: 2 periods (ultra-short for exit signals)

Additional Notes:
1. Works best in trending markets with clear directional bias
2. May generate false signals during ranging/choppy markets
3. Best applied to liquid instruments with strong momentum characteristics
4. Consider combining with volume confirmation for additional validation
5. Timeframe applicability: 1-hour charts and above recommended for reliability

Optimization Considerations:
1. ADX threshold could be adjusted between 20-30 based on instrument volatility
2. Bollinger Band period could be tested between 15-25 periods
3. RSI exit level could be tested between 65-75 for sensitivity adjustment
