STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Stochastic Oscillator Crossover:** The strategy uses the Stochastic Oscillator (typically 14,3,3 settings) to identify potential entry points when the %K line crosses above the %D line (bullish signal) or below the %D line (bearish signal).  
2. **ADX Confirmation:** The Average Directional Index (ADX) must be above 25 to confirm a strong trend, ensuring trades are only taken in high-momentum environments.  
3. **Trailing Stop Exit:** A trailing stop is set at 2x the 14-period Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits while allowing room for price fluctuations.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when the %K line crosses above the %D line in the Stochastic Oscillator AND the ADX is above 25.  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when the %K line crosses below the %D line in the Stochastic Oscillator AND the ADX is above 25.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** The stop-loss is dynamically adjusted to 2x the 14-period ATR below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the highest/lowest price reached since entry.  
- **Optional Exit:** Consider closing the trade if the ADX drops below 20, indicating weakening momentum.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** The initial stop-loss can be set at 1x ATR from entry, but the trailing stop takes over once the trade moves in your favor.  
3. **Avoid Low ADX:** Do not enter trades if ADX is below 25, as it suggests a lack of strong trend.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)** – For crossover signals.  
2. **Average Directional Index (ADX, 14-period)** – To confirm trend strength.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)** – For trailing stop placement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets (e.g., forex, commodities) and may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.  
- Backtest to optimize ATR multiplier (e.g., 1.5x or 2.5x) based on asset volatility.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., support/resistance levels) for higher-probability entries.  

This strategy combines momentum confirmation (ADX) with precise entry timing (Stochastic) and disciplined exit management (ATR trailing stop), making it a robust trend-following approach.
