STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Compression Detection**:  
   - **Bollinger Bands Width (10-day)**: Monitors narrowing bands, indicating reduced volatility.  
   - **Chaikin Volatility**: Confirms suppressed volatility when readings are low.  
2. **Breakout Trigger**:  
   - **Volume Surge**: Entry requires volume exceeding the 20-day average by 150%.  
   - **Price Confirmation**: 30-minute closing price must break outside the Keltner Channel.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup**:  
   - Bollinger Bands width must be narrowing (lower than recent 5-day average).  
   - Chaikin Volatility must be below its 10-day moving average.  
2. **Execution**:  
   - Wait for a volume spike â‰¥150% of the 20-day average.  
   - Confirm breakout with a 30-minute close outside the Keltner Channel (upper for long, lower for short).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit-Taking**:  
   - Trail stop using a 2x ATR (14-period) from the entry price.  
   - Alternatively, exit at 1.5x the initial Bollinger Band width at entry.  
2. **Stop-Loss**:  
   - Place below the Keltner Channel extreme (opposite side of the breakout) or 1x ATR from entry, whichever is tighter.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Limit to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading if broader market ATR (e.g., SPY) is >5% of price.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + Width (10-day SMA).  
2. Chaikin Volatility (10-day MA for suppression).  
3. Keltner Channel (20,2x ATR).  
4. Volume 20-day average + real-time surge detection.  
5. ATR (14) for stop/target sizing.  

**Unique Edge**: Combines *volatility compression* (Bollinger/Chaikin) with *volume-fueled breakouts*, reducing false signals via Keltner confirmation.
