STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines Bollinger Band width contraction, Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) divergence, and Keltner Channel extremes to identify short opportunities during volatility breakouts.  

### **Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Measures volatility compression, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Detects bearish divergence (price rising while CMF declines) to confirm weakening buying pressure.  
3. **Keltner Channel:** Used to define extreme price levels for exit signals.  

### **Entry Rules:**  
- **Bollinger Band Width:** Must be contracting (indicating low volatility before a breakout).  
- **CMF Divergence:** Price makes a higher high while CMF makes a lower high (bearish divergence).  
- **Trigger:** Enter short when price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band after contraction.  

### **Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop Loss:** If price closes above the upper Keltner Channel.  
- **Take Profit:** If price closes below the lower Keltner Channel (extreme move).  
- **Trailing Stop:** Adjust stop to breakeven if price moves favorably beyond a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2).  

### **Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stop distance).  
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

### **Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 StdDev) – For contraction and breakout detection.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)** (20-period) – For bearish divergence confirmation.  
3. **Keltner Channel** (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier) – For exit signals.  

This strategy is best suited for **mean-reversion traders** looking to capitalize on false breakouts in low-volatility environments. Backtesting on multiple timeframes (1H-4H) is recommended before live execution.
