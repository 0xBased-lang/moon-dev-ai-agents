STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricBreakout strategy is a dynamic approach that combines moving average crossovers with volume spikes to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. It focuses on capturing strong momentum moves while managing risk through a trailing stop mechanism.

Key Strategy Components:
1. EMA Crossover: Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as a primary trend confirmation signal.
2. Volume Spike: Requires trading volume to exceed 2x the 20-day average volume, indicating strong participation in the breakout.
3. ATR Trailing Stop: Implements a 1.5x ATR trailing stop to protect profits and limit losses.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross above the 200-period EMA (bullish signal).
2. Confirm the breakout with a volume spike exceeding 2x the 20-day average volume.
3. Enter a long position when both conditions are met on the same candle.

Exit Rules:
1. Use a trailing stop based on 1.5x the current ATR value.
2. The stop should trail below the highest high since entry.
3. Exit the position when price touches the trailing stop level.

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the ATR value to ensure consistent risk per trade.
2. Maximum risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of account equity.
3. Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic news events.

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. 20-day Average Volume
4. Average True Range (ATR) for trailing stop calculation

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest the strategy across different market conditions to ensure robustness.
- Consider implementing a time-based exit if the trade doesn't move in your favor within a specific period.
- Monitor for false breakouts by waiting for a candle close above the breakout level.
- Adjust the ATR multiplier (1.5x) based on market volatility and personal risk tolerance.

This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets and can be applied to various timeframes, though it's recommended to use it on daily or 4-hour charts for optimal results.
