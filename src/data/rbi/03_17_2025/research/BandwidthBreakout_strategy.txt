STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandwidthBreakout strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by high-volume breakouts. It combines Bollinger Band width analysis, volume spikes, and ATR-based trailing stops to identify high-probability breakout opportunities while managing risk effectively.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width: Measures the volatility contraction
2. Volume Analysis: Identifies breakout confirmation
3. ATR Trailing Stop: Manages exits and protects profits

Indicators Required:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Bollinger Band Width (20-period)
- 50-day Simple Moving Average of Volume
- 14-period Average True Range (ATR)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band Width to reach a 10-day low (volatility contraction)
2. Confirm volume spike above 50-day average volume
3. Enter long on breakout above upper Bollinger Band
4. Enter short on breakout below lower Bollinger Band

Exit Rules:
1. Use a trailing stop based on 2x ATR
2. For long positions: Trail stop below price at 2x ATR
3. For short positions: Trail stop above price at 2x ATR
4. Exit when price hits trailing stop level

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade
2. Calculate stop distance from entry to ATR level
3. Adjust position size to maintain consistent risk
4. Never risk more than 2% of account on any single trade

Additional Considerations:
- Best suited for liquid markets with clear trends
- Works well on daily or 4-hour timeframes
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability trades
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts

Optimization Tips:
- Test different ATR multiples (1.5x to 3x) for trailing stop
- Experiment with different Bollinger Band periods (14-26)
- Consider adding a minimum price movement filter (e.g., 1% above/below bands)
- Backtest across multiple instruments and timeframes

This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets and can be adapted to various asset classes. The combination of volatility contraction, volume confirmation, and ATR-based risk management creates a robust framework for capturing breakout moves while controlling downside risk.
