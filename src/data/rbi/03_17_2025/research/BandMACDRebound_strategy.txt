### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands**: Used to identify potential support levels near the lower band.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Buy Signal**:
   - Price must be near or touching the lower Bollinger Band (within 1-2% of the band).
   - MACD histogram must be above the zero line, indicating bullish momentum.
   - Ensure the MACD line (blue) is above the signal line (orange) for additional confirmation.

2. **Short Exit**:

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a take-profit level near the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) or the upper Bollinger Band, depending on market conditions.
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop to capture extended moves.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop-loss just below the lower Bollinger Band (e.g., 1-2% below the band) to limit downside risk.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
   - Use the lower Bollinger Band as a dynamic stop-loss level.

   - Only take trades when both Bollinger Bands and MACD conditions are met.
