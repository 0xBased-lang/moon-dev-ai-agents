STRATEGY_NAME: BandDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandDivergence strategy is a mean-reversion approach that combines Bollinger Bands and MACD histogram divergence to identify high-probability entry points. The strategy focuses on capturing reversals when the price crosses the upper Bollinger Band while showing bullish divergence on the MACD histogram.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands (BB):**
   - Upper Band: Used as a resistance level to identify overbought conditions.
   - Middle Band (SMA): Acts as a reference for mean reversion.
   - Lower Band: Not directly used in this strategy but provides context for overall volatility.

2. **MACD Histogram:**
   - Bullish Divergence: When the MACD histogram shows higher lows while the price is making lower highs or flat, indicating potential upward momentum.

3. **Price Action:**
   - Price crossing above the upper Bollinger Band signals overbought conditions, creating a potential mean-reversion opportunity.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Condition 1:** The price must cross above the upper Bollinger Band.
2. **Condition 2:** The MACD histogram must show bullish divergence (higher lows) at the same time or shortly after the price crosses the upper band.
3. **Entry Signal:** Enter a short position when both conditions are met, anticipating a mean reversion toward the middle band (SMA).

---

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit:** Close the position when the price reaches the middle Bollinger Band (SMA).
2. **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss slightly above the upper Bollinger Band to limit losses if the price continues to rise.
3. **Time-Based Exit:** If the price does not revert to the middle band within a predefined time frame (e.g., 5-10 candles), exit the trade to avoid prolonged exposure.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. **Stop Loss:** Always use a stop loss to protect against adverse price movements.
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio:** Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio (e.g., risking $10 to make $20).

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands:**
   - Period: 20 (default)
   - Standard Deviation: 2 (default)
   - Upper Band: Used for overbought signals.

2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**
   - Fast Length: 12 (default)
   - Slow Length: 26 (default)
   - Signal Smoothing: 9 (default)
   - Histogram: Used to identify divergence.

### Additional Notes:
- **Timeframe:** This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to reduce noise and false signals.
- **Market Conditions:** Ideal for ranging or slightly trending markets. Avoid using this strategy during strong trending markets, as the price may continue to move away from the upper band.
- **Confirmation:** Consider adding volume analysis or RSI to confirm overbought conditions for higher accuracy.

By combining Bollinger Bands and MACD divergence, the BandDivergence strategy provides a systematic approach to identifying mean-reversion opportunities with clear entry and exit rules.
