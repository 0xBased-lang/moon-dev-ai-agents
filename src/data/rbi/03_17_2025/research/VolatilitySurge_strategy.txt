STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilitySurge strategy is designed to capitalize on low-volatility environments that are accompanied by a sudden surge in trading volume, signaling potential breakout opportunities. The strategy combines historical volatility analysis with volume momentum to identify high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Historical Volatility (HV): Measures the 10-day price volatility to identify low-volatility conditions.
2. Volume Z-Score: Calculates the 5-day volume momentum relative to its historical average.
3. Average True Range (ATR): Used for setting dynamic profit targets and stop-loss levels.

Entry Rules:
- Go long when:
  1. 10-day Historical Volatility drops below 20% (indicating a low-volatility environment)
  2. 5-day Volume Z-Score exceeds 2 (signaling a significant increase in trading activity)

Exit Rules:
- Take profit at 2x ATR from entry price
- Stop loss at 1x ATR from entry price

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the ATR value to ensure consistent risk per trade.
2. Maximum risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of total capital.
3. Avoid trading during major news events or earnings announcements that could cause abnormal volatility.

Required Indicators:
1. 10-day Historical Volatility
2. 5-day Volume Z-Score (calculated as: (Current Volume - 20-day Volume Mean) / 20-day Volume Std Dev)
3. 14-day ATR

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest the strategy across different market conditions to ensure robustness.
- Consider adding a time-based exit (e.g., 5 days) if price doesn't reach target or stop.
- Monitor overall market volatility and adjust parameters accordingly.

This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform in choppy or range-bound conditions. It's particularly effective for stocks or instruments that tend to experience explosive moves after periods of low volatility.
