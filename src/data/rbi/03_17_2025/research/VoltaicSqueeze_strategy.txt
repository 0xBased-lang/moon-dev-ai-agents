STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicSqueeze strategy is a volatility-based breakout system that capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by explosive price movements. It uses Bollinger Bands and ATR (Average True Range) to identify high-probability trading opportunities.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - To identify volatility contraction
2. ATR (14) - For trailing stop placement
3. 30-day lookback period - To confirm the narrowest Bollinger Band width

Entry Rules:
1. Monitor Bollinger Band width daily
2. Confirm the current Bollinger Band width is the narrowest in the last 30 days
3. Wait for price to close above the upper Bollinger Band
4. Enter long position on the next candle's open

Exit Rules:
1. Set initial stop loss at 2x ATR below entry price
2. Trail stop loss upward using 2x ATR
3. Exit position when price hits trailing stop

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop loss distance determines position size
3. Maximum portfolio risk limited to 5% at any time

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. ATR (14)
3. Custom script to identify 30-day narrowest band width

Additional Notes:
- Works best on liquid assets with strong trending characteristics
- Ideal timeframe: Daily charts
- Recommended markets: Forex majors, large-cap stocks, and major indices
- Backtest across multiple market conditions before live trading
- Combine with fundamental analysis for better context

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5x to 3x) based on market volatility
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Test different lookback periods (20-50 days) for band width comparison

This strategy aims to capture the explosive moves that often follow periods of low volatility, while using ATR-based stops to lock in profits during strong trends.
