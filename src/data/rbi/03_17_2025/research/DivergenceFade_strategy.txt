STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceFade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergenceFade strategy is a trend-following approach that capitalizes on weakening MACD divergence combined with RSI confirmation to identify potential trend reversals. The strategy uses Fibonacci retracement levels for precise exit targeting.

Key Components:
1. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Primary indicator for divergence analysis
2. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Confirmation tool for weakening momentum
3. Fibonacci Retracement Levels - Exit targets based on price retracements

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for MACD to show weakening divergence (histogram bars decreasing in size)
2. Confirm with RSI showing lower readings (below 50 level preferred)
3. Enter long position when both conditions align with price action confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary target at 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level
2. Secondary target at 50% Fibonacci retracement level
3. Stop loss placed below recent swing low or based on ATR (Average True Range)

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Use proper position sizing based on stop loss distance
3. Implement trailing stops after reaching first target

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12,26,9 standard settings)
2. RSI (14 period)
3. Fibonacci Retracement Tool
4. Optional: ATR (14 period) for stop loss placement

Additional Notes:
- Best used on 1-hour or 4-hour charts for reliable signals
- Works well in trending markets with clear price swings
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation
- Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

This strategy combines the power of momentum analysis with precise Fibonacci-based exit planning, creating a systematic approach to trend-following trades with clear risk management parameters.
