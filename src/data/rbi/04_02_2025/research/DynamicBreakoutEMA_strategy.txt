STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicBreakoutEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum strength to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components are:

1. TREND CONFIRMATION:
- Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as primary trend confirmation
- This establishes the overall bullish bias for potential breakouts

2. MOMENTUM FILTER:
- Requires ADX (Average Directional Index) to be above 25
- Ensures the market has sufficient directional strength for the breakout
- ADX rising confirms increasing momentum

3. ENTRY RULES:
- Enter long when price makes a new high after the EMA crossover
- ADX must be above 25 and rising at time of entry
- Entry occurs on first candle closing above recent swing high

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Initial stop-loss set at 2x ATR (Average True Range) below entry
- Take-profit set at 3x ATR above entry
- 1.5:1 reward-to-risk ratio
- Position size calculated based on stop-loss distance

5. EXIT RULES:
- Exit when either:
  a) Price hits 3x ATR take-profit target
  b) Price hits 2x ATR stop-loss
  c) ADX falls below 25 (momentum weakening)

6. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- ADX (14-period standard setting)
- ATR (14-period standard setting)

7. OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add volume confirmation (rising volume on breakout)
- Wait for pullback to 50-EMA after crossover for better risk/reward
- Use higher timeframe (daily) EMAs for stronger confirmation

8. BEST MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best in trending markets
- Avoid ranging markets (ADX below 20)
- Most effective on liquid instruments with strong trends (major forex pairs, indices)

9. TIME FRAME CONSIDERATIONS:
- Works on all timeframes but most reliable on 1H or higher
- Lower timeframes may produce more false signals
- Daily timeframe provides strongest signals

10. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCIPLINE:
- Requires patience to wait for all conditions to align
- Must accept that some breakouts will fail
- Strict adherence to stop-loss rules is critical
