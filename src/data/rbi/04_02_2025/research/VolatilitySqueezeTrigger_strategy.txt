STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by potential breakout moves, combining Bollinger Bands contraction with historical volatility thresholds and ATR-based risk management.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. 20-day Historical Volatility (HV) calculation
3. Average True Range (14-period ATR) for stop placement
4. Volatility contraction threshold (user-defined HV level)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width must contract below the 20-day HV threshold (suggested default: 20% of average HV)
2. Confirmation: Price must be trading between the Bollinger Bands (not touching either band)
3. Entry Trigger: Long position initiated when price closes above the upper Bollinger Band

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking: No fixed take-profit - ride the trend until exit conditions met
2. Stop-loss: 2x ATR below entry price (trailing)
3. Emergency Exit: Close position if Bollinger Band width expands beyond 2x the entry width

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade (stop distance x position size)
2. Trailing stop adjusts daily using the 2x ATR formula
3. Volatility filter: Only trade when 20-day HV is above long-term average (avoids extremely low volatility periods)

Indicator Settings:
1. Bollinger Bands: 20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations
2. ATR: 14-period
3. Historical Volatility: 20-day standard deviation of logarithmic returns
4. Volatility Threshold: Adjustable parameter (default 20% of 100-day average HV)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different HV threshold percentages (15-25% range)
2. Experiment with ATR multiples (1.5x-2.5x) for stop placement
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for breakouts
4. May add time-based exit (e.g., 10 bars) if price doesn't follow through

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases, with the volatility squeeze identifying the consolidation period before potential breakouts. The ATR-based stop ensures dynamic risk management adjusted for current market conditions.
