STRATEGY_NAME: VortexMomentum  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Identifies trend direction and strength.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Measures volume-backed momentum to confirm divergence.  
3. **Divergence Detection:** Looks for discrepancies between price action and CMF to signal potential reversals or continuations.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  - CMF is above zero and showing bullish divergence (rising CMF while price is flat/declining).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  - CMF is below zero and showing bearish divergence (falling CMF while price is flat/rising).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (trend reversal signal).  
  - CMF drops below a predefined threshold (e.g., -0.1) indicating weakening momentum.  
- **Short Exit:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (trend reversal signal).  
  - CMF rises above a predefined threshold (e.g., +0.1) indicating weakening bearish momentum.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss orders based on recent swing highs/lows or ATR (Average True Range) multiples.  
- Position sizing should align with account risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)** – For trend direction and strength.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF, 20-period default)** – For volume-backed momentum confirmation.  
3. **Optional but Recommended:**  
   - ATR for dynamic stop-loss placement.  
   - Volume indicator to filter low-liquidity conditions.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading.  
- Avoid ranging markets; use ADX (above 25) to confirm trending conditions if needed.  
- Backtest optimal CMF thresholds (e.g., ±0.1 to ±0.2) for your asset class.  

This strategy combines trend-following (Vortex) with volume-based momentum (CMF divergence) for high-probability entries and disciplined exits.
