STRATEGY_NAME: VolSpikeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Breakout:** Uses the upper Bollinger Band (typically set to 2 standard deviations from a 20-period SMA) to identify potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires a significant spike in trading volume (at least 2x the 20-day average volume) to validate the breakout, reducing false signals.  
3. **Mean Reversion Exit:** Exits positions when price retraces to the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), capturing momentum while avoiding overextension.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Price closes **above** the upper Bollinger Band.  
  - Volume on the breakout candle is **at least double** the 20-day average volume.  
- **Confirmation:** Wait for the closing price to confirm the breakout (avoid intraday spikes).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking/Exit:** Close the position when price touches or crosses the 20-day SMA from above.  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** Set a stop-loss below the breakout candle’s low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) to limit downside risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Essential to mitigate whipsaws; adjust based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stops).  
- **Avoid Overcrowded Breakouts:** Filter for volume spikes significantly higher than average to ensure institutional participation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** Default settings for breakout detection.  
2. **20-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Acts as the exit benchmark.  
3. **20-Day Average Volume:** Used to quantify the volume spike threshold.  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines volatility expansion (Bollinger Band) with volume confirmation, reducing false breakouts common in low-volume environments.  
- Exits at mean reversion level (20 SMA), balancing trend capture and avoiding late-cycle reversals.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different multiples for volume spikes (e.g., 1.5x–3x) to adapt to asset liquidity.  
- Adjust Bollinger Band deviations (e.g., 1.5–2.5) based on asset volatility.  
- Avoid using during low-volatility regimes (e.g., when Bollinger Bands contract significantly).  

**Best Suited For:**  
- High-liquidity stocks or ETFs with strong trending tendencies.  
- Intraday or swing trading (timeframe-agnostic but ideal on 1H/daily charts).
