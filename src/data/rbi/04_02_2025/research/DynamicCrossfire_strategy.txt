STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicCrossfire

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicCrossfire strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum analysis to identify high-probability trading opportunities while avoiding overbought conditions. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to create a robust trading framework.

Key Components:
1. EMA Crossover (50-period & 200-period) - Primary trend confirmation
2. ADX (25 threshold) - Trend strength filter
3. RSI (70 threshold) - Overbought exit signal

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 50-period EMA to cross ABOVE the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross)
2. Confirm the ADX is above 25, indicating strong trend strength
3. Only enter long positions when both conditions are met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor RSI for values crossing BELOW 70 from above
2. Exit the position when RSI shows this overbought reversal signal
3. Alternative exit: If the 50-EMA crosses back below 200-EMA (Death Cross)

Risk Management:
1. Recommended stop-loss: 2-3% below entry price or below recent swing low
2. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false signals
4. Consider time-based exits if RSI doesn't trigger (e.g., 5-10 day hold period)

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Average Directional Index (ADX) with 14-period default setting
4. Relative Strength Index (RSI) with 14-period default setting

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for daily or 4-hour timeframes in trending markets
- Works well with liquid assets showing clear trends
- Combine with price action confirmation for higher accuracy
- Backtest suggested for optimal ADX threshold (25-30 range)
- Consider volume confirmation for additional validation

The DynamicCrossfire strategy provides a balanced approach between trend-following and momentum analysis, aiming to capture the middle portion of strong trends while avoiding late-cycle entries near potential reversals.
