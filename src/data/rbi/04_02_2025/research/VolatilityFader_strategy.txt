STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFader

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility channel breakouts with volume-weighted divergence signals to identify potential mean-reversion opportunities. Here are the key components:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Keltner Channel (volatility-adjusted): Uses ATR for channel width to identify overextended price moves
- VWAP Divergence: Measures the difference between price and volume-weighted average price
- Volume-Weighted RSI: Traditional RSI weighted by trading volume for mean-reversion signals

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Short Entry: When price closes above upper Keltner Channel AND VWAP divergence exceeds threshold (e.g., 2%)
- Long Entry: When price closes below lower Keltner Channel AND VWAP divergence exceeds threshold (e.g., -2%)

3. EXIT RULES:
- For short positions: When volume-weighted RSI crosses below oversold threshold (e.g., 30)
- For long positions: When volume-weighted RSI crosses above overbought threshold (e.g., 70)
- Alternative exit: When price returns inside Keltner Channel

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing based on ATR (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade)
- Stop-loss placed at opposite Keltner Channel band
- Maximum holding period (e.g., 5 bars) to prevent excessive drawdown

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2xATR(20) width)
- VWAP (standard calculation)
- Volume-weighted RSI (14-period)
- ATR (20-period for position sizing)

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Adjust Keltner Channel multiplier (1.5-3x ATR)
- Test different VWAP divergence thresholds (1-3%)
- Experiment with RSI periods (10-20) and thresholds (30/70 or 20/80)

This strategy works best in ranging markets with periodic volatility expansions and is particularly effective on liquid instruments with consistent volume patterns.
