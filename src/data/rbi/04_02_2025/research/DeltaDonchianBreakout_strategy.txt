STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaDonchianBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines price channel dynamics with volume divergence to identify high-probability short entries. The key components are:  

1. **Key Components**:  
   - **Donchian Channel (Lower Band)**: Acts as the primary breakout level for short entries.  
   - **Negative Delta Volume Divergence**: Confirms bearish momentum when price breaks lower while volume shows increasing selling pressure.  
   - **20-Period Volume-Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)**: Serves as the dynamic exit threshold.  

2. **Entry Rules**:  
   - Initiate a short position when:  
     - Price closes below the lower Donchian Channel (e.g., 20-period).  
     - Negative delta volume divergence is present (e.g., price makes lower lows while volume delta becomes increasingly negative).  

3. **Exit Rules**:  
   - Close the short position when price retraces and closes above the 20-period VWMA.  
   - Optional: Use a trailing stop based on recent swing highs or a fixed ATR multiple to protect profits.  

4. **Risk Management**:  
   - Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
   - Stop-loss: Place initial stop above the recent swing high or the upper Donchian Band.  
   - Filter: Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic events to reduce false breakouts.  

5. **Required Indicators**:  
   - Donchian Channel (20-period recommended).  
   - Volume delta (difference between buying and selling volume).  
   - Volume-Weighted Moving Average (20-period).  

**Note**: This strategy excels in trending markets but may generate whipsaws in ranging conditions. Always validate divergence with price action (e.g., lower highs confirming bearish structure).
