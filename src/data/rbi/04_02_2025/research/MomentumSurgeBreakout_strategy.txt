STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSurgeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with volume expansion to identify high-probability breakout opportunities, while using volatility contraction as an exit signal. The key components create a robust framework for capturing strong trending moves while managing risk.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)**: Measures the strength of momentum, with +50 representing strong bullish momentum.  
2. **Volume Surge Filter**: Requires volume to exceed twice the 20-day average, confirming institutional participation.  
3. **Bollinger Band Width Threshold**: Used to identify volatility contraction for exits, signaling potential trend exhaustion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long when:  
  1. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) crosses **above +50** (confirming strong bullish momentum).  
  2. Current trading volume exceeds **2x the 20-day average volume** (validating breakout strength).  
- Entry is triggered at the **next candle's open** after both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit when:  
  Bollinger Band Width (BB Width) falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., lower 20% of its recent range), indicating volatility contraction and potential trend weakening.  
- Alternatively, use a trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR) to lock in profits during strong trends.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop placed below the recent swing low or using a volatility-based stop (e.g., 1.5x ATR).  
3. **Avoid Overexposure:** Do not take new trades if the market is in a low-volatility regime (BB Width too narrow).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO, default 14-period).  
2. Volume (20-day average as a baseline).  
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2) â€“ Specifically, the Band Width (BB Width) for exits.  
4. Optional: ATR (14-period) for dynamic stop placement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid ranging conditions.  
- Higher timeframes (e.g., 1H or 4H) reduce false signals.  
- Backtest optimal BB Width threshold for exits (e.g., 20th percentile of recent values).  

This strategy capitalizes on strong momentum shifts with volume confirmation while exiting before volatility collapses, making it ideal for swing trading breakouts.
