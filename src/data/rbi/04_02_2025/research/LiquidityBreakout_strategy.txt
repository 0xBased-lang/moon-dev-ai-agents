STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines order book liquidity analysis with volatility filtering to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The core concept revolves around trading in the direction of liquidity pools when price approaches clustered liquidation levels during favorable low-volatility conditions.

Key Components:
1. Liquidity Cluster Identification: Uses order book delta to detect significant liquidity clusters (potential liquidation levels)
2. Volatility Filter: 4-hour ATR must be below its 30-day median to qualify as a low volatility environment
3. Directional Bias: Trades only in the direction of the dominant liquidity pool
4. Protective Stops: Places stops beyond the opposite liquidity cluster

Entry Rules:
1. Confirm low volatility condition (4H ATR < 30-day median ATR)
2. Identify clustered liquidation levels via order book delta analysis
3. Wait for price to approach a liquidity cluster (within 1-2% of level)
4. Enter long if approaching lower cluster with upper cluster as target
5. Enter short if approaching upper cluster with lower cluster as target

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: When price reaches opposite liquidity cluster
2. Stop Loss: Placed just beyond the opposite liquidity cluster (1-2% beyond)
3. Time Exit: Close position if no movement occurs within 24 hours

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance to stop (1-2% risk per trade)
2. Maximum daily loss limit (e.g., 5% of capital)
3. No trading during high-impact news events
4. Stop moved to breakeven when price reaches 50% of target

Required Indicators:
1. Order Book Delta (for liquidity cluster identification)
2. 4-hour ATR (for volatility filter)
3. 30-day median ATR (as volatility benchmark)
4. Price action confirmation (candlestick patterns at liquidity levels)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Requires reliable order book data feed
- Most effective on liquid assets with clear liquidity pools
- Backtest suggested timeframes: 15min-4H charts
- Ideal for forex majors and large-cap crypto pairs
