STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityQuietus

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityQuietus strategy is a mean-reversion approach that capitalizes on periods of compressed volatility in trending markets. The name combines "Volatility" (the core market condition being traded) with "Quietus" (Latin for quiet/calm, representing the low-volatility entry condition).

Key Components:
1. Trend Filter: 200-period EMA (bullish bias only)
2. Volatility Measurement: 5-minute ATR (14-period default)
3. Volatility Threshold: 20-period SMA of ATR
4. Exit Mechanism: 2x ATR spike or 1% trailing stop

Entry Rules:
1. Price must be above the 200-period EMA (confirming bullish trend)
2. Current 5-minute ATR value must cross BELOW its 20-period SMA
3. Enter long position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Emergency Exit: If ATR spikes to 2x its entry value (volatility expansion)
2. Trailing Stop: 1% below the highest high since entry
3. Whichever condition triggers first exits the trade

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk of account per trade
2. Stop loss initially set at 1% below entry (becomes trailing after entry)
3. No trades during major news events (when ATR may be unreliable)

Required Indicators:
1. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 14-period Average True Range (ATR)
3. 20-period Simple Moving Average of ATR (ATR_SMA)

Optimal Market Conditions:
- Works best in trending markets with periodic volatility contractions
- Avoid ranging markets where the 200EMA filter may give false signals
- Most effective on liquid assets with consistent volatility patterns

Additional Notes:
- Recommended timeframes: 5-minute to 1-hour charts
- Works well when combined with volume confirmation
- Backtest suggested for asset-specific parameter optimization
- Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., >30) to avoid oversold traps

The "Quietus" in the name reflects the strategy's core premise - entering when volatility becomes unusually quiet relative to recent activity, with defined exits for when the quiet period ends.
