STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelAccelBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Donchian Channel breakout dynamics with momentum confirmation through Rate of Change (ROC) and volume analysis for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period upper band)
2. Rate of Change (14-period recommended)
3. Volume (20-day average as filter)
4. Channel midpoint as dynamic exit level

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Price must close above the Donchian Channel upper band (20-period)
2. Momentum Confirmation: Rate of Change must be accelerating (current ROC > previous ROC)
3. Volume Filter: Current volume must exceed 20-day average volume
4. All three conditions must be met simultaneously for entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Close position when price closes below the Donchian Channel midpoint
2. Optional Stop-Loss: Consider adding a fixed percentage stop (e.g., 2-3%) below entry price
3. Time-based Exit: Consider exiting after X days if target not reached (optional)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk parameters (1-2% per trade recommended)
2. Avoid entering when volatility is extreme (check ATR or Bollinger Band width)
3. Consider correlation with broader market trends for additional confirmation
4. Best suited for trending markets - avoid ranging conditions

Required Indicators:
1. Donchian Channel (20-period)
2. Rate of Change (14-period standard setting)
3. Volume (with 20-day moving average)
4. Optional: ATR for volatility assessment

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different Donchian periods (20-50) for various instruments
2. Adjust ROC period based on trading timeframe
3. Volume average period can be tuned (10-30 days)
4. Works best on daily/weekly timeframes for swing trading

This ChannelAccelBreakout strategy provides a systematic approach to trading breakouts with built-in momentum and volume confirmation, while using the channel structure for clear exit signals. The combination of these elements helps filter false breakouts and improves trade quality.
