STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction with volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The core concept revolves around detecting periods of compressed volatility (squeeze) followed by a significant volume surge, signaling potential explosive moves.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width: Measures volatility contraction when hitting 10-day lows
2. Volume Surge: 50% increase from average volume confirms breakout potential
3. Keltner Channel: Provides dynamic exit targets based on average true range

Entry Rules:
- Trigger: Bollinger Band width reaches 10-day low (volatility squeeze condition)
- Confirmation: Current volume exceeds 50% of 20-day average volume
- Execution: Enter long position when both conditions are met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: When price touches upper Keltner Channel line
- Secondary Exit: If Bollinger Band width expands beyond 2x its squeeze level without reaching target

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: Place below recent swing low or lower Keltner Channel
3. Time Exit: Close position if target not hit within 5 days of entry

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator
3. Keltner Channel (20,2 ATR multiplier)
4. Volume (20-day average)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust volume surge threshold (40-60%) based on asset volatility
- Test different squeeze duration (7-14 days) for optimal results
- Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., >30) to avoid oversold conditions

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases, capturing the initial momentum burst while managing risk through volatility-based exits.
