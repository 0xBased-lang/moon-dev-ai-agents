STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Heatmaps:** Identifies high liquidation zones where price is likely to reverse due to forced liquidations.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV) Divergence:** Confirms reversal signals when price approaches liquidation zones while OBV shows divergence (e.g., price makes a higher high but OBV makes a lower high).  
3. **Keltner Channel Exits:** Uses volatility-adjusted Keltner Channels to determine exit points, ensuring trades are closed before momentum shifts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Signal:** Price approaches a high liquidation zone (from heatmap data).  
- **Confirmation:** OBV shows divergence (bearish divergence for short entries, bullish divergence for long entries).  
- **Action:** Enter trade in the direction of the reversal (short if bearish divergence, long if bullish divergence).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit:** Close position when price breaches the opposite Keltner Channel band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs).  
- **Volatility Adjustment:** Keltner Channel width is dynamically adjusted based on recent ATR (Average True Range) or similar volatility metrics.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place stop-loss just beyond the liquidation zone to avoid false breakouts.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Tight stop-loss beyond the liquidation zone to limit downside.  
- **Volatility Filter:** Avoid trading if recent volatility exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., ATR spike).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Liquidation Heatmap (from exchange or third-party data).  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV).  
3. Keltner Channel (adjusted by ATR or volatility metric).  
4. Optional: ATR for volatility filtering.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in high-liquidity markets with clear liquidation zones.  
- Avoid using during low-liquidity periods or major news events.  
- Backtest to optimize Keltner Channel parameters (e.g., multiplier, lookback period).  

This strategy capitalizes on forced liquidations while using OBV divergence and volatility-adjusted exits to improve accuracy.
