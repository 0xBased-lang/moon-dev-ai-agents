STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility analysis with momentum signals to capture breakout opportunities while using mean reversion for exits. Here are the key components:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO): Measures momentum strength
- 20-day rolling volatility: Creates dynamic threshold for CMO signals
- Bollinger Band %B: Identifies mean reversion points for exits

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Go LONG when:
  1. CMO crosses ABOVE its dynamic threshold (20-day rolling volatility * adjustment factor)
  2. Price shows volatility expansion (confirmed by recent volatility increase)
- Optional confirmation: Volume spike or price breaking recent high

3. EXIT RULES:
- Close position when:
  1. Bollinger Band %B crosses back below 0.5 (mean reversion)
  2. Or when %B reaches extreme level (e.g., >0.8 for profit taking)
  3. Stop-loss at recent swing low or volatility-based stop (e.g., 2x ATR)

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., 1% risk per trade)
- Dynamic stop-loss adjustment based on current volatility
- Maximum portfolio exposure limit (e.g., 20% in volatile markets)

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-period recommended)
- 20-day historical volatility (standard deviation of returns)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations) with %B calculation
- Optional: ATR (14-period) for stop-loss calculation

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Adjust CMO period (14-21 days) based on market conditions
- Test different volatility multipliers (1.5-2.5x) for threshold
- Experiment with Bollinger Band settings for exits

7. BEST APPLICATIONS:
- Works well in trending markets with periodic volatility expansions
- Effective on liquid assets with clear volatility patterns (stocks, forex majors)
- Timeframes: 1H charts or higher recommended

8. WARNING SIGNS:
- Avoid trading during low volatility regimes (CMO may give false signals)
- Be cautious when VIX is at extremes (market may be overextended)
- Watch for divergence between price and CMO

This strategy requires regular volatility monitoring and benefits from periodic parameter adjustments to match changing market conditions.
