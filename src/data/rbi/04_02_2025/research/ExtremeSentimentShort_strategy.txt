STRATEGY_NAME: ExtremeSentimentShort  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on extreme bullish sentiment in crypto perpetual futures markets by identifying statistically significant deviations in funding rates and long/short ratios, then executing short positions with defined exits.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Sentiment Extremes Detection**  
   - Funding Rate: Short when current funding rate exceeds +2 standard deviations from its 30-day moving average  
   - Long/Short Ratio: Confirm with 90th percentile readings (extreme skew toward longs)  

2. **Technical Exit Signal**  
   - Lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2SD) acts as profit-taking level  
   - 24-hour time-based exit for risk control  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Calculate 30-day moving average and standard deviation of funding rates  
2. Trigger short entry when BOTH conditions are met:  
   - Current funding rate > (30D MA + 2SD)  
   - Long/short ratio â‰¥ 90th percentile of its historical distribution  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. Primary Exit: Close position when price touches lower Bollinger Band  
2. Secondary Exit: Automatic close after 24 hours (prevents overnight risk)  

**Risk Management:**  
- Recommended 1-2% position sizing per trade  
- Avoid trading during major macroeconomic events  
- Stop-loss optional (strategy relies on mean reversion, but could implement 1.5x ATR stop if desired)  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Funding rate data (exchange-specific)  
2. Long/short ratio (exchange-provided or from aggregators like Coinalyze)  
3. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)  
4. Standard deviation calculator for funding rates  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different lookback periods (30/60/90 days) for funding rate SD calculation  
- Adjust percentile threshold (85th-95th) for long/short ratio based on asset volatility  
- Consider adding volume confirmation to filter false signals  

This strategy works best in trending bull markets where excessive leverage creates frequent mean reversion opportunities. Backtest across multiple assets to account for varying funding rate behaviors.
