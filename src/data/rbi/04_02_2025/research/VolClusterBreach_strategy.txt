STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterBreach

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines on-chain liquidation data with technical Bollinger Band analysis to trade volatility contractions following liquidity events. The approach focuses on identifying high-probability reversal zones where market structure has been disrupted by liquidations.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Zones (On-chain):
   - Identify high-density liquidation levels from on-chain data
   - These act as support/resistance zones where price may reverse

2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) Analysis:
   - Monitor for BBW spikes followed by contraction
   - Signals volatility expansion then compression

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger:
   - Price must breach a liquidation cluster zone (either above resistance or below support)
   - BBW must show contraction after a recent spike (volatility settling)

2. Confirmation:
   - Wait for price to pull back to the breached liquidation zone
   - Entry when price shows rejection at this level (pinbar, engulfing etc.)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - First target at opposing liquidation cluster zone
   - Final target at next significant cluster beyond

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place below recent swing low (longs) or above swing high (shorts)
   - Alternative: 1.5x recent average true range

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Adjust position size based on distance to stop

2. Trade Filter:
   - Only take trades where liquidation cluster zones align with higher timeframe support/resistance
   - Avoid trading during major news events

Required Indicators:
1. On-chain:
   - Liquidation heatmap (showing cluster zones)
   - Liquidation volume indicators

2. Technical:
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard settings)
   - Bollinger Band Width (BBW)
   - Volume profile
   - Basic candlestick patterns

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 4H and daily timeframes for crypto markets
- Requires clean liquidation data feed (preferably from multiple exchanges)
- Most effective when combined with slight RSI divergence at entry points
- Avoid trading this during extreme trending markets without pullbacks

The VolClusterBreach strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency to reverse after liquidity grabs, using the combination of on-chain data and volatility contraction to identify high-probability setups. The unique aspect is waiting for both the liquidity breach AND subsequent volatility contraction before entering.
