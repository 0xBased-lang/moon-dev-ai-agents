STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **On-Chain Liquidation Clusters:** The strategy identifies high liquidation zones using on-chain data, which act as potential breakout points due to forced liquidations creating price inefficiencies.  
2. **Volatility Contraction:** Requires 1-hour volatility to be below the 20-day average, indicating a potential breakout setup with reduced noise.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** Entries are triggered when price approaches these liquidation clusters, signaling a potential breakout.  
4. **ATR-Based Exits:** Uses a 2x ATR (Average True Range) from the entry point to define profit targets, ensuring a systematic exit.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Identify high liquidation clusters via on-chain data (e.g., liquidation heatmaps or order book analysis).  
- Confirm 1-hour volatility is below the 20-day average (e.g., using Bollinger Band width or standard deviation).  
- Enter long/short on a breakout above/below the liquidation cluster with a confirmed close beyond the cluster boundary.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Set profit target at 2x ATR from the entry price.  
- Use a trailing stop or fixed stop-loss (e.g., 1x ATR) to protect against reversals.  
- Exit immediately if volatility expands sharply (e.g., 1-hour volatility exceeds the 20-day average post-entry).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on ATR (e.g., risk 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events to prevent false breakouts.  
- Diversify across assets to reduce correlation risk.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. On-chain liquidation data (e.g., liquidation heatmaps, order book imbalance).  
2. Volatility metric (e.g., Bollinger Band width, standard deviation).  
3. ATR (14-period recommended) for exit and stop-loss placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines on-chain liquidation data with volatility contraction for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses ATR for dynamic profit targets, adapting to market conditions.  
- Focuses on liquidity-driven moves rather than pure technical patterns.  

This strategy is ideal for traders who want to capitalize on liquidity-driven breakouts while managing risk through volatility filters and ATR-based exits.
