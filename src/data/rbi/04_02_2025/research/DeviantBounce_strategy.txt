STRATEGY_NAME: DeviantBounce

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This mean-reversion strategy combines extreme funding rate deviations with Bollinger Band breaches to identify high-probability long entries in perpetual swap markets.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Extremes: Uses -2 standard deviations below 30-day average funding rates to identify oversold conditions
2. Price Extremes: Requires price to breach the lower Bollinger Band (typically set to 20 periods, 2 std dev)
3. Profit Targets: Middle Bollinger Band serves as primary exit, with 2% gain as secondary target

Entry Rules:
1. Calculate 30-day average funding rate and standard deviation
2. Wait for funding rate to drop below -2 standard deviations of its average
3. Confirm price has breached the lower Bollinger Band
4. Enter long position when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price reaches the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
2. Secondary Exit: If 2% profit is reached before hitting middle band
3. No stop-loss specified (consider adding for risk management)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should account for potential volatility
2. Consider adding stop-loss at recent swing low or percentage-based
3. Avoid trading during high volatility events that may distort funding rates

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 std dev)
2. 30-day funding rate average and standard deviation
3. Price chart for visual confirmation

Optimization Considerations:
1. Test different standard deviation thresholds (-1.5 to -2.5)
2. Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (14-26)
3. Adjust profit target percentages (1.5-3%)
4. Consider adding volume confirmation

This strategy capitalizes on market overreactions shown through both funding rate extremes and price deviations, with built-in profit-taking at mean reversion points. The unique combination of derivatives market data (funding rates) with technical indicators creates a distinctive edge.
