STRATEGY_NAME: VolBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
The **VolBreakout** strategy is designed to capitalize on high-probability breakout opportunities by combining overnight price action, volume surges, and volatility expansion. The strategy filters for meaningful breakouts by requiring confirmation from multiple market dynamics, reducing false signals.  

### **Key Components:**  
1. **Overnight Session High/Low**: Uses the high and low price range from the overnight trading session (typically 4:00 PM - 9:30 AM EST for US markets) as key reference levels.  
2. **Relative Volume Surge**: Requires a **50% increase** in volume compared to the 20-day average volume at the time of breakout.  
3. **Volatility Expansion**: Confirms breakout strength by requiring the **1-hour realized volatility** to exceed the **20-day average volatility**.  

### **Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Price breaks **above** the overnight high **AND** volume is **50% higher** than the 20-day average **AND** 1-hour realized volatility exceeds the 20-day average.  
- **Short Entry**: Price breaks **below** the overnight low **AND** volume is **50% higher** than the 20-day average **AND** 1-hour realized volatility exceeds the 20-day average.  

### **Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**:  
  - **Fixed Risk-Reward Ratio (1:2 or 1:3)** – Exit at a predefined multiple of the initial risk (e.g., 2x or 3x the stop distance).  
  - **Trailing Stop** – Adjust stop to lock in profits if the trade moves favorably (e.g., 1.5x ATR trailing stop).  
- **Stop Loss**:  
  - **Fixed Stop**: Place stop at the **midpoint of the overnight range** (for mean-reversion protection).  
  - **Volatility-Based Stop**: Use **1.5x the 1-hour ATR** from entry price.  

### **Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than **1-2% of capital per trade**.  
- **Avoid Overlapping Signals**: If multiple breakouts occur, prioritize the one with the strongest volume & volatility confirmation.  
- **Time Filter**: Only trade breakouts within the **first 2 hours of the regular session** (9:30 AM - 11:30 AM EST) to avoid late-day noise.  

### **Required Indicators:**  
1. **Overnight High/Low** (from pre-market session).  
2. **Volume Comparison** (current volume vs. 20-day average).  
3. **Realized Volatility** (1-hour vs. 20-day average).  
4. **ATR (Average True Range)** for dynamic stop placement.  

### **Additional Notes:**  
- Works best on **liquid assets** (SPY, QQQ, ES futures, major forex pairs).  
- Avoid using during **low-volume periods** (holidays, pre-FOMC).  
- Backtest for optimal **timeframe & volatility threshold adjustments**.  

This strategy ensures high-quality breakout trades by filtering for **volume-fueled momentum** and **volatility expansion**, reducing whipsaws and increasing win rate.
