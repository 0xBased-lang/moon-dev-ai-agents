STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFade  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Market Context:** This strategy focuses on fading (counter-trading) extreme price spikes caused by liquidations in the market. It identifies these spikes using Bollinger Band width expansion and open interest drops.  
2. **Indicators Used:**  
   - **Bollinger Bands (BB):** Measures volatility and identifies extreme price deviations (width > 3 standard deviations).  
   - **Open Interest (OI):** Tracks the number of outstanding derivative contracts; a sharp drop signals liquidation events.  
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Used to confirm overbought/oversold conditions for exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Trigger Condition:**  
   - Bollinger Band width exceeds 3 standard deviations (indicating extreme volatility).  
   - Open interest shows a sharp decline (confirming liquidation-driven price action).  
2. **Trade Direction:**  
   - **Short Entry:** If the price spikes upward (liquidation squeeze) and meets the above conditions.  
   - **Long Entry:** If the price spikes downward (liquidation flush) and meets the above conditions.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **RSI-Based Exit:**  
   - For short positions: Exit when RSI crosses below a predefined lower threshold (e.g., 30).  
   - For long positions: Exit when RSI crosses above a predefined upper threshold (e.g., 70).  
2. **Alternative Exit:** Consider a trailing stop or time-based exit if the RSI threshold is not reached within a reasonable period.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Use conservative sizing due to the high volatility of liquidation events.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss beyond recent swing highs/lows to account for potential continuation of the spike.  
3. **Confirmation:** Avoid entering if the open interest drop is not significant or if Bollinger Band width is not convincingly expanded.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 3 standard deviations).  
2. Open Interest (derivatives data).  
3. RSI (14-period, with thresholds at 30 and 70).  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in highly leveraged markets (e.g., crypto, futures) where liquidations are frequent.  
- Backtest for optimal RSI thresholds and Bollinger Band settings based on the assetâ€™s volatility profile.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., wicks, volume spikes) for higher-probability entries.
