STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation level analysis with RSI divergence to identify high-probability counter-trend entries. The approach focuses on detecting market exhaustion points where forced liquidations create potential reversal opportunities.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Level Detection: Identifies "open interest cliffs" - sudden drops in open interest indicating potential liquidation events
2. Divergence Confirmation: Uses 2-hour RSI to spot bullish/bearish divergences against price action
3. Swing Structure: Analyzes nearest swing highs/lows for stop placement and confirmation

Entry Rules:
- Long Entry:
  1. Spot a significant drop in open interest (liquidation event)
  2. Observe bullish RSI divergence (higher lows in RSI while price makes lower lows)
  3. Price must be near a visible support level
  4. Enter on first bullish candle closing above previous candle high

- Short Entry:
  1. Spot a significant increase in open interest (potential long squeeze)
  2. Observe bearish RSI divergence (lower highs in RSI while price makes higher highs)
  3. Price must be near a visible resistance level
  4. Enter on first bearish candle closing below previous candle low

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: 
  1. Primary target at 1.5x risk (distance from entry to stop)
  2. Secondary target at 2.5x risk for partial closes
  3. Exit fully if RSI reaches overbought (longs) or oversold (shorts) territory

- Stop Loss:
  1. Placed beyond the nearest swing high (for shorts) or swing low (for longs)
  2. Adjust stop to breakeven when price reaches 1x risk
  3. Trail stop at swing points as trend develops

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Never enter without clear divergence confirmation
3. Avoid trading during major news events when liquidations may continue
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. Open Interest (OI) chart/indicator
2. 2-hour RSI (14 period standard settings)
3. Price action swing point analysis
4. Volume profile (optional but recommended for confirmation)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for crypto markets with high leverage and frequent liquidations
- Most effective on 15m-1h timeframes for entries
- Requires patience to wait for proper divergence setups
- Works best in ranging or mildly trending markets (avoid strong trends)

This strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency to overextend during liquidation events, using RSI divergence as confirmation of potential reversals while maintaining strict risk controls around swing structure.
