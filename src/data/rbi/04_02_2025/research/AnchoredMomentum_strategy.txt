STRATEGY_NAME: AnchoredMomentum  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks:** Used to filter trends by smoothing price action and identifying sustained momentum.  
2. **Anchored VWAP:** Calculated from significant swing points (highs/lows) to act as dynamic support/resistance.  
3. **Volume Skew Confirmation:** Rising volume on pullbacks validates the strength of the retracement.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Heikin-Ashi candles show a consistent uptrend (green candles with no lower wicks).  
  2. Price pulls back to anchored VWAP support (calculated from a recent swing low).  
  3. Volume skew rises during the retracement, indicating accumulation.  
  4. Enter on the first Heikin-Ashi green candle closing above the anchored VWAP.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. Heikin-Ashi candles show a consistent downtrend (red candles with no upper wicks).  
  2. Price retraces to anchored VWAP resistance (calculated from a recent swing high).  
  3. Volume skew rises during the retracement, indicating distribution.  
  4. Enter on the first Heikin-Ashi red candle closing below the anchored VWAP.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Trail using the Heikin-Ashi trend: Exit when the candle color reverses (green to red for longs, red to green for shorts).  
  - Alternatively, target 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the last 14 candles.  

- **Stop Loss:**  
  - Place below the anchored VWAP (for longs) or above it (for shorts).  
  - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) or the recent swing low/high.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk per trade: 1-2% of capital.  
- Position sizing adjusted based on stop-loss distance.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks  
2. Anchored VWAP (customizable anchor points)  
3. Volume Skew Indicator (or volume spike detection)  
4. Optional: ATR (14-period) for profit targets  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines smoothed trend identification (Heikin-Ashi) with dynamic levels (anchored VWAP).  
- Volume skew acts as a confirmation filter, reducing false pullback entries.  
- Adapts to changing market conditions by recalculating VWAP from recent swing points.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize anchor point selection (e.g., swing lows/highs of the last 5-20 candles) and volume skew thresholds.
