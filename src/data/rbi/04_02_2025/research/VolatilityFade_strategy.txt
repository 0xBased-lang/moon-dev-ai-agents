STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFade  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Fading:** The strategy capitalizes on extreme price moves exceeding 3x the daily Average True Range (ATR), anticipating a mean-reversion retracement.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires a surge in trading volume (150% of the 20-day average) to validate the extreme move and increase the likelihood of a reversal.  
3. **VWAP Target:** Aims for price retracement to the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), a key intraday benchmark for fair value.  
4. **Aggressive Stop-Loss:** Uses a wide stop-loss at 5x ATR to account for high volatility while allowing room for the trade to develop.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger when price moves **3x the daily ATR** beyond the previous close (either up or down).  
- Confirm with **volume exceeding 150% of the 20-day average** to ensure participation in the extreme move.  
- Enter in the **opposite direction** of the extreme move (fade the spike).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Close the position when price retraces to **VWAP**.  
- **Stop-Loss:** Exit if price moves **5x the daily ATR** against the entry (beyond the initial extreme).  
- **Time-Based Exit:** Consider closing the trade by end-of-day if targets arenâ€™t met, as extreme moves may stabilize.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the wide stop (5x ATR) to limit risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during major news events or illiquid periods where volatility spikes may persist.  
- Prioritize fading moves in **liquid assets** to ensure volume reliability.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR):** 1-day period to gauge extreme moves.  
2. **Volume Average:** 20-day simple moving average of volume for surge detection.  
3. **VWAP:** Intraday benchmark for profit-taking.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in **mean-reverting markets** (e.g., indices, large-cap stocks).  
- Avoid trending assets or breakouts where extremes may continue.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., rejection candles at extremes) for higher accuracy.  

This strategy thrives on overextended volatility exhaustion, leveraging volume and ATR to define high-probability fade opportunities.
