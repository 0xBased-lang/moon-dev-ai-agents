STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):**  
   - Uses VI+ (positive trend) and VI- (negative trend) lines to identify trend direction.  
   - A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-, indicating potential upward momentum.  
   - A bearish signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+, indicating potential downward momentum.  

2. **Choppiness Index (CI):**  
   - Measures market consolidation (range-bound conditions).  
   - Low CI values (typically below 38.2) suggest trending conditions, making VI crossovers more reliable.  
   - High CI values (above 61.8) suggest consolidation, avoiding false signals.  

3. **Average Directional Index (ADX):**  
   - Confirms trend strength.  
   - A flattening or declining ADX slope (e.g., dropping below 25) signals weakening momentum, triggering exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI-.  
  - CI < 38.2 (low consolidation, trending environment).  
  - ADX > 20 (confirming trend strength).  

- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+.  
  - CI < 38.2.  
  - ADX > 20.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - ADX slope turns flat or declines below 25.  
  - VI- crosses back above VI+ (early reversal signal).  

- **Short Exit:**  
  - ADX slope turns flat or declines below 25.  
  - VI+ crosses back above VI-.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Place below the recent swing low (long) or above the recent swing high (short).  
  - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  

- **Take-Profit:**  
  - Trail stop based on ADX slope or CI rising above 50 (returning to consolidation).  
  - Fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-).  
2. Choppiness Index (CI) – 14-period default.  
3. Average Directional Index (ADX) – 14-period default.  

**Unique Edge:**  
This strategy filters out false VI crossovers by requiring low CI (trending markets) and confirms exits using ADX slope decay, making it adaptive to changing market conditions.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Adjust CI thresholds (e.g., 30-40 for low, 60-70 for high) based on asset volatility.  
- Test ADX slope sensitivity (e.g., 20 vs. 25 for trend strength threshold).  
- Combine with volume confirmation for higher accuracy.
