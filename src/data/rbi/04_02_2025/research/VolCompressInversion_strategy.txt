STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Inversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme volatility compression combined with market sentiment shifts, using a multi-indicator approach for high-probability entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - Measures volatility compression
2. VIX Term Structure - Identifies fear-driven market conditions
3. 20-day Moving Average - Defines trend direction
4. Put/Call Ratio - Confirms bearish sentiment

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: BBW reaches 6-month low (extreme volatility compression)
2. Confirmation: VIX term structure inverts (front month > back month)
3. Entry Trigger: Price closes below lower Bollinger Band while conditions 1-2 are met

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Price breaks above 20-day MA with above-average volume
2. Sentiment Confirmation: Put/Call ratio spikes > 1.2x 10-day average
3. Emergency Exit: BBW expands beyond 2x entry level (volatility expansion)

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: 2x ATR(14) below entry point
3. Time Exit: Close position after 10 days if no exit triggers hit
4. Maximum Drawdown: 5% per trade

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW)
3. VIX Futures Term Structure
4. 20-day Simple Moving Average
5. Put/Call Ratio (10-day MA)
6. ATR(14) for stop calculation
7. Volume indicator

Optimization Notes:
- Backtest BBW lookback period (3-9 months)
- Test various put/call ratio thresholds (1.1-1.5x)
- Experiment with different MA periods (10-50 days)
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.5-3x) based on volatility regime

This strategy works best in transitioning markets where prolonged low volatility precedes significant moves. The VIX inversion adds confirmation that professional traders are pricing in increased risk.
