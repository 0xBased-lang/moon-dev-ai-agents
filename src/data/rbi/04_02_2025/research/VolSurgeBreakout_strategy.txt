STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Adjusted Breakout:** Uses a 20-period Donchian Channel to identify breakout levels adjusted for market volatility.  
2. **Volume Surge Filter:** Requires a 3-day volume surge exceeding 200% of the 30-day median volume to confirm breakout validity.  
3. **Keltner Channel Exit:** Exits trades based on 4-hour candle closes breaching the 10-period Keltner Channel, ensuring dynamic trailing stops.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Price closes above the upper band of the 20-period Donchian Channel **AND** 3-day volume is >200% of the 30-day median volume.  
- **Short Entry:** Price closes below the lower band of the 20-period Donchian Channel **AND** 3-day volume is >200% of the 30-day median volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** 4-hour candle closes below the lower band of the 10-period Keltner Channel.  
- **Short Exit:** 4-hour candle closes above the upper band of the 10-period Keltner Channel.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stop).  
- Stop-loss can be placed at the opposite Donchian Channel band (for initial risk control).  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic events to reduce false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Donchian Channel (20-period)** – Defines breakout levels.  
2. **Volume (30-day median & 3-day surge)** – Filters high-probability breakouts.  
3. **Keltner Channel (10-period)** – Dynamic exit mechanism.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility expansion (Donchian) with volume confirmation for high-conviction breakouts.  
- Uses Keltner Channel for adaptive exits, reducing whipsaw risk compared to fixed stops.  
- Volume surge requirement minimizes false signals in choppy markets.
