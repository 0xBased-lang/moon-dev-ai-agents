STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** The primary directional signal generator.  
2. **Volume Surge Filter:** Requires a 50% increase in volume compared to recent average to confirm strength.  
3. **ATR Expansion:** Uses the 14-day ATR exceeding its 30-day average to identify volatility expansion, validating the trade setup.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  1. **VI+ crosses above VI-** (bullish signal).  
  2. **Volume surges by 50% or more** compared to the recent average (confirms participation).  
  3. **14-day ATR > 30-day ATR average** (confirms volatility expansion).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the trade when:  
  1. **VI- crosses back below VI+** (bearish reversal signal).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:**  
   - Set below the recent swing low or use a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1.5x 14-day ATR).  
2. **Position Sizing:**  
   - Adjust based on volatility (e.g., risk 1-2% of capital per trade).  
3. **Time-Based Exit:**  
   - Consider exiting if the trade does not follow through within 3-5 bars to avoid stagnation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)** – For trend direction.  
2. **Volume (50% surge confirmation)** – For momentum validation.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR 14 vs. 30)** – For volatility filter.  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy combines trend (Vortex), momentum (volume surge), and volatility (ATR) for high-probability entries.  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid sideways conditions.  
- Backtest for optimal volume/ATR parameters based on the asset.  

**Example Setup:**  
1. VI+ crosses above VI- on daily chart.  
2. Volume spikes 50% above 20-day average.  
3. 14-day ATR > 30-day ATR average.  
4. Enter long, stop below swing low.  
5. Exit when VI- crosses below VI+.  

**Name Justification:**  
- "Vortex" reflects the core indicator.  
- "Surge" captures the volume/volatility expansion requirement, making it distinct from basic Vortex strategies.
