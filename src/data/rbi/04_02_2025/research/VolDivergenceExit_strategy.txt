STRATEGY_NAME: VolDivergenceExit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility channel breakouts with volume divergence for high-probability entries and uses dynamic channel-based stops for exits.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period, 2.5x ATR multiplier) - defines volatility boundaries
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) - detects volume divergence
3. Trailing stop mechanism based on channel width

Entry Rules:
1. LONG Entry Trigger:
   - Price closes above upper Keltner Channel
   - OBV shows negative divergence (price making higher highs while OBV makes lower highs)
   - Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit:
   - OBV confirms price movement by making new high
2. Secondary Exit:
   - Trailing stop triggered (set at 1x channel width below recent high)
3. Emergency Exit:
   - Price closes below lower Keltner Channel

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at lower Keltner Channel (or 1.5x channel width for tighter stops)
3. No trades taken when channels are unusually narrow (volatility contraction)

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channels (20EMA, 2.5x ATR(20))
2. On-Balance Volume (standard settings)
3. ATR (20) for channel width calculation

Optimization Notes:
- Channel multiplier can be adjusted between 2.0-3.0 based on asset volatility
- OBV lookback period for divergence can be 3-5 periods
- Trailing stop multiple can range from 0.8x to 1.5x channel width

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear volume patterns, while the channel-based exits help protect profits during volatile swings. The negative volume divergence filters out false breakouts, increasing win rate.
