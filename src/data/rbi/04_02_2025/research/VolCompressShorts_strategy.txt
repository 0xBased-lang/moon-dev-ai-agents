STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressShorts

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines funding rate extremes with volatility compression patterns to identify high-probability short opportunities in crypto markets.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Extremes: Uses 30-day funding rate exceeding historical 90th percentile as overleveraged condition
2. Volatility Compression: Identified via Keltner Channel contraction followed by expansion
3. Liquidation Dynamics: Incorporates average liquidation move for exit targeting

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 30-day funding rate > 90th percentile historical value
2. Confirmation: 
   - Keltner Channel (20-period, 2.5x ATR) shows 3-day contraction (width decreases)
   - Followed by channel expansion (width increases) indicating volatility breakout
3. Entry: Short position on confirmed channel expansion

Exit Rules:
1. Funding Normalization: When current funding rate drops below 75th percentile
2. Price Retracement: If price moves against position by 1.5x average liquidation move
   - Calculate average liquidation move as 20-day mean of daily liquidation spikes
3. Whichever condition occurs first triggers exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% per trade
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Initial: 2x average liquidation move from entry
   - Trailing: Adjust to 1x liquidation move after favorable move
3. Maximum Portfolio Exposure: 10-15% across all active positions

Required Indicators:
1. Funding Rate Data (30-day and historical percentile)
2. Keltner Channel (20-period, 2.5x ATR multiplier)
3. Average True Range (14-period for volatility measurement)
4. Liquidation Data (for calculating average liquidation moves)

Optimization Notes:
1. Backtest different Keltner Channel periods (14-30 days)
2. Test various ATR multipliers (2.0-3.0x)
3. Validate percentile thresholds for funding rates
4. Adjust liquidation move multiplier (1.0-2.0x) based on asset volatility

This strategy capitalizes on the combination of overleveraged conditions (via funding rates) and volatility regime shifts, targeting the explosive unwinding of crowded long positions. The exit logic incorporates both mean-reversion of funding rates and liquidation cascade dynamics for optimal timing.
