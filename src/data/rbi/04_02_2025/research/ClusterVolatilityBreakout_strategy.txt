STRATEGY_NAME: ClusterVolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines on-chain liquidation data with technical indicators to identify high-probability breakout opportunities from key liquidity zones. The core concept revolves around detecting dense stop-loss clusters (liquidation zones) where price movements may accelerate due to forced liquidations, while volatility contraction signals potential explosive moves.

Key Components:
1. On-Chain Liquidation Data: Identifies price levels with high concentration of stop-loss orders (liquidation clusters)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth: Measures volatility contraction (threshold <1%)
3. Volume Confirmation: Validates breakout authenticity

Entry Rules:
1. Identify liquidation cluster zones from on-chain data (typically 1-2% above/below current price)
2. Wait for price to test the liquidation zone
3. Confirm Bollinger Bandwidth <1% (20-period, 2 std dev)
4. Enter long if price breaks above cluster with increasing volume
5. Enter short if price breaks below cluster with increasing volume

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry
2. Stop loss placed at opposite side of the liquidation cluster
3. Emergency exit if bandwidth expands beyond 3% without directional move

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss always placed (never trade without)
3. No trades during major news events (avoid false breakouts)
4. Daily loss limit of 5% (stops trading if hit)

Required Indicators:
1. On-chain liquidation heatmap (external data source)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) with bandwidth calculation
3. Volume indicator (preferably with MA comparison)
4. Average True Range (14-period for target calculation)

Optimization Notes:
- Best suited for 4H-1D timeframes on liquid assets
- Works particularly well on crypto derivatives (BTC, ETH perpetuals)
- Requires clean on-chain data feed for liquidation clusters
- Bandwidth threshold may need adjustment for different assets

This strategy capitalizes on the market mechanics where liquidity clusters become both magnets (attracting price) and accelerators (when broken) while volatility contraction increases the likelihood of a sustained breakout. The combination of on-chain data with technical filters creates a robust edge in detecting high-probability breakout scenarios.
