STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines On-Balance Volume (OBV) divergence with Bollinger Band squeeze patterns to identify high-probability trading opportunities during low volatility periods. The strategy capitalizes on the explosive moves that often follow volatility contractions.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection: 
   - Uses standard 20-period Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations)
   - Squeeze occurs when bandwidth (upper band - lower band) reaches 6-month lows

2. OBV Divergence Confirmation:
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower low while OBV makes higher low
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher high while OBV makes lower high
   - Requires at least 3 consecutive diverging price/OBV points

3. Volatility Band Exit:
   - 20-period rolling volatility band (ATR-based)
   - Calculated as close ± (2 * ATR(20))

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for confirmed Bollinger Band squeeze (narrowest bandwidth in 6 months)
2. Identify OBV divergence pattern during squeeze period
3. Enter at the close of the squeeze candle in direction of OBV divergence:
   - Long if bullish divergence
   - Short if bearish divergence

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking: 
   - Close position when price breaches opposite volatility band
   - Long exits when price crosses below (close - 2*ATR(20))
   - Short exits when price crosses above (close + 2*ATR(20))

2. Stop-loss:
   - Initial stop placed at recent swing low/high
   - Trailing stop activated after price moves 1.5*ATR in profit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Avoid trading during major news events
3. Maximum of 3 concurrent positions
4. Daily time frame recommended for best results

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV)
3. Average True Range (ATR 20)
4. Custom volatility bands (close ± 2*ATR)

Optimization Notes:
- Backtest different ATR multiples (1.5-3) for volatility bands
- Experiment with squeeze duration requirements
- Test various OBV lookback periods for divergence confirmation

This strategy works best in ranging markets and requires patience to wait for high-quality setups. The combination of volume confirmation with volatility contraction provides a robust edge when properly executed.
