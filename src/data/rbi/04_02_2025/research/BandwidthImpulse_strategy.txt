STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthImpulse  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction patterns with trend strength confirmation via ADX to identify high-probability breakout opportunities.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Measures volatility compression by tracking the difference between upper/lower bands (width = (upper_band - lower_band)/middle_band). A 6-month low signals extreme compression.  
2. **ADX Trend Confirmation:** Requires ADX > 25 to ensure the breakout occurs within an established trend, avoiding false signals in choppy markets.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** When both conditions are met:  
  (1) Bollinger Band Width reaches its lowest level in 6 months  
  (2) ADX crosses above 25  
  Enter at the closing price after confirmation.  
- **Short Entry:** Same conditions as long, but for downward breakouts.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** 1.5x the Bollinger Band Width value at entry (e.g., if width was 2% at entry, target 3% price move).  
- **Stop Loss:** Exit when price touches the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., exit long if lower band is hit).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the distance between entry and opposite band to maintain consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% account risk).  
- Avoid trading during major economic events that may distort volatility readings.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations)  
2. ADX (14-period default recommended)  

**Unique Edge:**  
The strategy capitalizes on "volatility springs" â€“ periods of extreme contraction followed by directional impulses, filtered by ADX to avoid whipsaws. The 1.5x target leverages mean-reversion tendencies post-breakout.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different ADX thresholds (e.g., 20-30) for varying asset classes.  
- For intraday use, adjust the 6-month lookback to a proportional timeframe (e.g., 30-day low for daily charts).
