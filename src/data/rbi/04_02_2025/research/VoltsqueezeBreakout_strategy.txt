STRATEGY_NAME: VoltsqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This intraday strategy combines multiple volatility and breakout concepts to identify high-probability trading opportunities during market compression periods. The approach focuses on catching explosive moves following periods of low volatility, with multiple confirmation layers for entries and dynamic exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement:
   - Bollinger Band Width Percentile (20-period) to identify compressed volatility conditions
   - Threshold: Enter when width falls below 20th percentile of recent readings

2. Breakout Confirmation:
   - Keltner Channel (20-period, 2.5 ATR multiplier) breakout
   - Must close outside channel with expanding volume

3. Volume Surge:
   - Volume must be 150% of 20-period average
   - Volume spike should accompany breakout candle

Entry Rules:
Long Entry:
1. BB Width Percentile < 20%
2. Price closes above upper Keltner Channel
3. Volume > 1.5x 20-period average
4. Entry on next candle's open

Short Entry:
1. BB Width Percentile < 20%
2. Price closes below lower Keltner Channel
3. Volume > 1.5x 20-period average
4. Entry on next candle's open

Exit Rules:
1. Chandelier Stop (22-period, 3 ATR multiplier):
   - Longs: Trail below highest high since entry
   - Shorts: Trail above lowest low since entry

2. Profit Targets:
   - Primary: 1.5x recent ATR (10-period)
   - Secondary: 3x recent ATR
   - Scale out 50% at each target

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop placed at opposite Keltner Channel band
2. Position size limited to 1% risk per trade
3. Maximum 3 concurrent positions
4. No trades during first/last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Keltner Channels (20,2.5ATR)
3. Volume Average (20-period)
4. ATR (10-period for targets, 22-period for stops)
5. Bollinger Band Width Percentile study

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust ATR multipliers based on instrument volatility
- Test different percentile thresholds (15-25%) for BB width
- Verify volume surge ratio across different market caps

This strategy works best in trending market conditions and may produce false breakouts during choppy periods. The multiple confirmation layers help filter low-quality setups while the dynamic exits lock in profits during strong moves.
