STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **EMA Crossover Signal:** The strategy uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as a primary bullish breakout signal.  
2. **Low Volatility Filter:** Only trades are taken when the Average True Range (ATR) is below its 20-day average, indicating a period of consolidation before a potential breakout.  
3. **ATR-Based Risk Management:** Exits are determined using a 2x ATR stop-loss (risk control) and a 1.5x ATR take-profit (reward capture).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when the 50-period EMA crosses above the 200-period EMA (bullish signal).  
- **Volatility Confirmation:** The current ATR must be below its 20-day average to confirm a low-volatility environment.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Placed at 2x the current ATR value below the entry price (adjusts dynamically with volatility).  
- **Take-Profit:** Set at 1.5x the current ATR value above the entry price (scalps profit during breakout momentum).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop-loss to ensure controlled risk per trade.  
- Avoid trading during high ATR periods to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
2. **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-period default)**  
4. **20-day Simple Moving Average of ATR (for volatility filter)**  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Avoid using during high-impact news events that may cause erratic volatility.  
- Backtest on multiple assets to confirm robustness across different market conditions.  

This strategy combines breakout momentum with volatility filtering for higher-probability trades while maintaining disciplined risk/reward ratios.
