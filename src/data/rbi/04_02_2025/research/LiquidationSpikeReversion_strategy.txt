STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationSpikeReversion  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on extreme market conditions where a sudden spike in negative funding rates coincides with elevated liquidation heatmap levels, indicating potential short-term overextension and a high probability of mean reversion.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Negative Funding Rate Spike:** Identifies when funding rates drop sharply into negative territory, suggesting excessive short positioning.  
2. **Liquidation Heatmap Surge:** Confirms market stress by detecting clusters of liquidations, often preceding short squeezes.  
3. **4H VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):** Serves as the mean-reversion target for profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  - Funding rate drops sharply (e.g., >2 standard deviations below its 7-day average).  
  - Liquidation heatmap shows concentrated short liquidations (e.g., top 5% of 30-day levels).  
  - Price is below the 4H VWAP (confirming undervaluation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close position when price retraces to the 4H VWAP.  
- Emergency exit if funding rate flips positive or liquidation heatmap dissipates abruptly.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size: 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Stop-loss: 1.5x the distance between entry and 4H VWAP.  
- Time exit: Auto-close after 6 candles if target not hit.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Real-time funding rate data (exchange API).  
2. Liquidation heatmap (e.g., Coinalyze, Hyblock).  
3. 4H VWAP with lookback period matching the funding rate spikeâ€™s timeframe.  

**Unique Edge:**  
Combines sentiment (funding rate) with liquidity dynamics (heatmap) to pinpoint exhaustion points, while VWAP provides an objective mean-reversion anchor. Avoids chasing pumps/dumps by waiting for confluence.
