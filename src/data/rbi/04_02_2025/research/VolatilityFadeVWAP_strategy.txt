STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFadeVWAP

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band width analysis with VWAP dynamics to identify and capitalize on mean-reversion opportunities during periods of excessive volatility. The core approach involves fading volatility spikes when they reach extreme percentile thresholds while confirming with volume-weighted price action.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Percentile (20-period lookback)
2. 20-period Volume-Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
3. VWAP Slope (flattening condition)
4. Volume analysis (retracement confirmation)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Bollinger Band width exceeds 90th percentile of its 20-period lookback
2. Confirmation: VWAP slope flattens (absolute value < 0.1% per period)
3. Execution: Enter short on high-volume retracement toward 20-period VWMA when:
   - Price approaches within 0.5 standard deviations of VWMA
   - Current volume > 20-period volume average
   - RSI(14) > 60 (for short entries) or < 40 (for long entries)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry
2. Stop Loss: 1x ATR from entry
3. Time Exit: Close position after 5 periods if targets not hit
4. Early Exit: VWAP slope steepens (> 0.3% per period in either direction)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily trades: 3
3. Stop placement: Beyond recent swing high/low
4. Volatility filter: No trades if ATR > 3% of price

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. VWAP with slope calculation
3. Volume-weighted moving average (20)
4. Volume oscillator
5. RSI (14)
6. ATR (14)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust percentile threshold (85-95) based on asset volatility
- Fine-tune VWAP slope parameters for different timeframes
- Consider adding MACD cross confirmation for stronger signals
- Test various ATR multiples for profit targets

This strategy works best in ranging markets with periodic volatility expansions and is particularly effective on liquid stocks or forex pairs during non-news periods. The combination of volatility percentile, volume confirmation, and VWAP dynamics creates a robust mean-reversion framework.
