STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Clusters:** Uses exchange liquidation heatmaps to identify high-probability zones where price may accelerate due to forced liquidations.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Waits for volatility contraction (Bollinger Band squeeze) as a precursor to potential explosive moves.  
3. **Volume-Weighted Parabolic SAR:** Exits trades when the parabolic SAR flips direction, weighted by volume to confirm reversal validity.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long when:  
  1. Price approaches a liquidation cluster (long liquidations dominate heatmap).  
  2. Bollinger Band width is below a threshold (e.g., 20-period SMA of width < X% of price).  
  3. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with confirmation volume.  
- Enter short when:  
  1. Price approaches a liquidation cluster (short liquidations dominate heatmap).  
  2. Bollinger Band width is below the same threshold.  
  3. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with confirmation volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit long when:  
  1. Volume-weighted parabolic SAR (e.g., SAR calculated using volume-adjusted sensitivity) flips below price.  
  2. Or if Bollinger Band width expands beyond a dynamic threshold (e.g., 2x the squeeze baseline).  
- Exit short when:  
  1. Volume-weighted parabolic SAR flips above price.  
  2. Or if Bollinger Band width expands beyond the dynamic threshold.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Allocate 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Stop-loss: Place stops just beyond the opposite Bollinger Band or recent swing low/high.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., weekends, holidays).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 StdDev).  
2. **Liquidation Heatmap** (exchange-specific data feed).  
3. **Volume-Weighted Parabolic SAR** (custom implementation adjusting SAR sensitivity based on volume spikes).  
4. **Volume Confirmation** (e.g., 1.5x average volume on breakout).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines liquidity dynamics (forced liquidations) with volatility contraction/expansion and volume-filtered reversals for high-probability breakouts.
