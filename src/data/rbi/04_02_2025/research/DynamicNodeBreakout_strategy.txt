STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicNodeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Dynamic VWAP Anchoring:** The strategy uses a Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) dynamically anchored to recent high-volume nodes, ensuring the breakout levels adapt to current market conditions.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Filter:** A cooldown period is enforced when Bollinger Band Width is compressed, indicating low volatility and reducing false breakout signals.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** Trades are only taken when price convincingly crosses the dynamically-adjusted VWAP, ensuring the breakout has momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Breakout Signal:** Enter a long position when price closes above the dynamically-adjusted VWAP. Enter a short position when price closes below the VWAP.  
2. **Volatility Filter:** Only take trades when the Bollinger Band Width is above a predefined threshold (e.g., not in a compressed state), ensuring sufficient volatility for a valid breakout.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Ensure the breakout is accompanied by above-average volume to confirm genuine interest.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Use a trailing stop or a fixed multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the recent swing high (for shorts), or use a percentage of the ATR.  
3. **Early Exit:** Exit the trade if Bollinger Band Width compresses significantly during the trade, indicating loss of momentum.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Loss Discipline:** Always adhere to the stop loss level to prevent large drawdowns.  
3. **Trade Frequency:** Avoid over-trading by waiting for high-probability setups that meet all criteria.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Dynamic VWAP:** Anchored to recent high-volume nodes for adaptive breakout levels.  
2. **Bollinger Bands:** To measure volatility and filter trades during low-volatility periods.  
3. **Volume Indicator:** To confirm breakout strength.  
4. **Average True Range (ATR):** For setting stop loss and profit targets.  

This strategy combines adaptive breakout levels with volatility filtering to capture high-probability moves while avoiding false signals in choppy markets.
