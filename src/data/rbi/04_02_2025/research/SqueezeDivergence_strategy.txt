STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze**: Identifies periods of low volatility where price is consolidating, often preceding significant breakouts.  
2. **VWAP Divergence**: Uses Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) to confirm trend strength and direction when price breaks out of the squeeze.  
3. **Volume Confirmation**: Ensures breakout validity by requiring increased trading volume.  
4. **ATR-Based Exit**: Uses Average True Range (ATR) to set dynamic profit targets and manage risk.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. Bollinger Bands are in a squeeze (bands narrow significantly, indicating low volatility).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. VWAP crosses above its moving average (e.g., 20-period VWAP MA) with above-average volume.  
- **Short Entry**:  
  1. Bollinger Bands are in a squeeze.  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. VWAP crosses below its moving average with above-average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**:  
  - Close long position when price touches the lower Bollinger Band or reaches 2x ATR from entry.  
  - Close short position when price touches the upper Bollinger Band or reaches 2x ATR from entry.  
- **Stop Loss**:  
  - For longs: Exit if price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands or below VWAP.  
  - For shorts: Exit if price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands or above VWAP.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major economic events that may cause false breakouts.  
- Monitor for sudden VWAP reversals to exit early if divergence weakens.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).  
2. VWAP with a moving average (e.g., 20-period MA of VWAP).  
3. Volume indicator (to confirm breakout strength).  
4. Average True Range (ATR, 14-period for dynamic exits).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with volume-weighted trend confirmation (VWAP divergence).  
- Uses ATR for adaptive profit targets instead of fixed price levels.  
- Filters false breakouts with volume and VWAP crossovers.  

This strategy excels in trending markets after consolidation phases, capturing early momentum with reduced noise.
