STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiSqueezeReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation cluster detection through funding rate acceleration with Bollinger Band squeezes to identify high-probability reversal opportunities in volatile markets. The approach capitalizes on market overextensions where excessive leverage meets technical compression patterns.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Acceleration: Monitors the rate of change in perpetual swap funding rates to detect extreme sentiment and potential liquidation clusters
2. Bollinger Band Squeeze: Identifies periods of exceptionally low volatility (compression) preceding potential explosive moves
3. Volatility Expansion: Uses Bollinger Band width expansion as confirmation of momentum shift
4. Funding Rate Normalization: Tracks when extreme funding rates return to mean levels

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: 
   - Funding rate acceleration reaches 90th percentile of historical values (extreme bullish/bearish sentiment)
   - Simultaneous Bollinger Band squeeze (band width in lowest 20th percentile)
   - Price at extreme Bollinger Band (upper band for short entries, lower band for long entries)

2. Confirmation:
   - Volume spike (minimum 1.5x 20-period average)
   - RSI divergence (price making new extreme while RSI fails to confirm)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - When price reaches opposite Bollinger Band (from entry band)
   - OR when volatility expansion reaches 2x squeeze threshold

2. Stop Loss:
   - Hard stop at 1.5x Bollinger Band width from entry
   - Emergency stop if funding rate reverses direction sharply (50% retracement from extreme)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 
   - 1-2% risk per trade based on stop distance
   - Reduce size during high VIX regimes (>30)

2. Trade Filtering:
   - Only trade when both signals align (funding rate + squeeze)
   - Avoid news events and macro announcements
   - Require minimum 1:3 risk/reward ratio

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Funding Rate Acceleration (3-period ROC of funding rates)
3. Volume (20-period MA)
4. RSI (14-period)
5. Bollinger Band Width indicator

Special Considerations:
- Works best on 4H-1D timeframes for crypto perpetuals
- Requires monitoring of multiple exchanges for accurate funding rate data
- Most effective in ranging markets with occasional volatility spikes
- Combine with order book analysis for additional confirmation

Optimization Tips:
- Backtest different percentile thresholds for funding rate extremes
- Experiment with Bollinger Band periods (20 vs 50)
- Test various band width squeeze definitions
- Adjust profit targets based on average true range
