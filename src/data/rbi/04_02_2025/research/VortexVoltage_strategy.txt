STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVoltage

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines the Vortex Indicator (VI) for trend direction confirmation
- Uses Volume-Weighted ADX (VWADX) to identify volatility expansions
- Requires both trend and volatility confirmation for entries
- Implements fixed risk-adjusted profit targets for systematic exits

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry:
  + VI+ (positive trend) must cross above VI- (negative trend)
  + VWADX(14) must be above 25 threshold (confirmed volatility)
  + Volume must be above 20-period average
- Short Entry:
  + VI- must cross above VI+
  + VWADX(14) > 25
  + Volume above 20-period average

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: Opposite VI crossover (VI- crosses above VI+ for longs, VI+ crosses above VI- for shorts)
- Secondary Exit: Fixed 1:2 risk-reward ratio (stop loss to take profit)
- Emergency Exit: If VWADX drops below 15 (volatility contraction)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss placed at recent swing low/high (for long/short respectively)
- Trailing stop activates after price moves 1.5x initial risk

5. Required Indicators:
- Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-) - default 14 period
- Volume-Weighted ADX (VWADX) - 14 period ADX weighted by volume
- Volume MA - 20 period simple moving average of volume

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1H or 4H timeframes
- Requires confirmation from both indicators to avoid false signals
- Performs best in trending markets, may underperform in ranging conditions
- Recommended to combine with price action confirmation at key levels

This "VortexVoltage" strategy creates a systematic approach to trading volatility expansions in the direction of the prevailing trend, with built-in safeguards against false breakouts and clear risk management protocols.
