STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeAccum  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands Width:** Measures volatility contraction (squeeze) when the width hits 3-month lows, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** Confirms accumulation phase with an ascending OBV trend, indicating strong buying pressure.  
3. **Breakout/Reversal Signals:** Uses Bollinger Band breakout (price crossing upper/lower band) or volume reversal (OBV trend break) for exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long when:  
  - Bollinger Bands width is at a 3-month low (volatility squeeze).  
  - OBV is in a confirmed uptrend (higher highs/lows).  
- Enter short when:  
  - Bollinger Bands width is at a 3-month low.  
  - OBV is in a confirmed downtrend (lower highs/lows).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take profit:  
  - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band (long) or below the lower band (short).  
- Stop loss:  
  - OBV reverses trend (breaks its recent high/low structure).  
  - Fixed percentage or ATR-based stop for additional protection.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Trailing stops can be applied after breakout confirmation.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false squeezes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 Std Dev).  
2. Bollinger Band Width (derived from BB).  
3. On-Balance Volume (OBV).  
4. Optional: ATR for dynamic stop placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (mean-reversion signal) with volume-based accumulation/distribution confirmation.  
- Filters false breakouts by requiring OBV alignment.  
- Works best in ranging or consolidating markets with periodic volatility expansions.
