STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility indicators with market sentiment to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during low-volatility periods. The core concept revolves around detecting when short-term volatility (measured by ATR) begins expanding after a period of contraction (when VIX is below average).

Key Components:
1. ATR (14-period) - Measures recent price volatility
2. ATR Moving Average (20-period) - Smooths volatility readings
3. VIX 10-day average - Gauges overall market volatility sentiment
4. 2x ATR trailing stop - Dynamic exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 5-minute ATR (14) crosses ABOVE its 20-period moving average
2. Confirmation Filter: Current VIX must be BELOW its 10-day average
3. Execution: Enter long position on next candle's open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop: Maintain a stop loss at 2x the current ATR value below the highest high since entry
2. Stop Adjustment: Update the stop level whenever price makes a new high
3. No profit target - Let the trailing stop determine the exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Calculate based on 1% risk of account balance
2. Maximum Risk: Stop distance (2xATR) should equal 1% of account
3. No pyramiding - Single position only
4. Time Filter: Avoid trading first/last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. ATR (14-period)
2. Moving Average of ATR (20-period)
3. VIX index with 10-day simple moving average
4. Price chart with high/low tracking for trailing stop

Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending market conditions
- Ideal for liquid instruments (major indices, forex pairs)
- Requires volatility contraction (low VIX) preceding expansion
- The 2x ATR stop provides room for normal volatility while protecting gains
