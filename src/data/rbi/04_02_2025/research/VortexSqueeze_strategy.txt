STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines the Vortex Indicator's trend confirmation with Bollinger Bandwidth contraction to identify high-probability breakout trades. The approach focuses on entering trades only when volatility is low (as indicated by Bollinger Bandwidth) and the Vortex Indicator confirms a strong trend direction.  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):**  
   - VI+ (Positive Vortex) measures upward trend movement.  
   - VI- (Negative Vortex) measures downward trend movement.  
   - A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-.  
   - A bearish signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+.  

2. **Bollinger Bandwidth:**  
   - Measures the percentage difference between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands.  
   - Low bandwidth indicates contraction (low volatility), often preceding breakouts.  
   - A threshold of the 20-day average bandwidth is used to confirm low volatility.  

3. **Breakout Confirmation:**  
   - Entry is triggered when the Vortex Indicator aligns with the trend direction AND Bollinger Bandwidth is below its 20-day average.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish Vortex signal).  
  2. Bollinger Bandwidth is below its 20-day average (low volatility).  
  3. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band (confirms breakout).  

- **Short Entry:**  
  1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish Vortex signal).  
  2. Bollinger Bandwidth is below its 20-day average (low volatility).  
  3. Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band (confirms breakout).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:**  
  - Close the trade when price reaches a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
  - Alternatively, exit when Bollinger Bandwidth expands significantly (volatility increases).  

- **Stop Loss:**  
  - For long trades: Place below the recent swing low or lower Bollinger Band.  
  - For short trades: Place above the recent swing high or upper Bollinger Band.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Adjust position size based on stop-loss distance.  
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause erratic volatility.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-).  
2. Bollinger Bands (standard settings: 20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
3. Bollinger Bandwidth (calculated as: (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading.  
- Avoid using in ranging markets; wait for clear trend signals.  
- Backtest to optimize the Bollinger Bandwidth threshold if needed.  

This strategy capitalizes on the "squeeze" effect (low volatility) combined with Vortex trend confirmation to catch strong breakouts with reduced false signals.
