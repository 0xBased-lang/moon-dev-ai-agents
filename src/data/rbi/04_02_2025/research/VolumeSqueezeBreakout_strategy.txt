STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume surges with Bollinger Band contraction to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components are:

1. KEY INDICATORS:
- Volume: Current day's volume must be at least 2x the 20-day average volume
- Bollinger Bands: Bandwidth (percentage difference between upper/lower bands) must be at 10-day low
- ATR (14-period): Used for trailing stop calculation

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Trigger when both conditions occur simultaneously:
  a) Today's volume â‰¥ 2 * 20-day average volume
  b) Bollinger Bandwidth reaches 10-day low
- Enter long if price breaks above upper Bollinger Band
- Enter short if price breaks below lower Bollinger Band

3. EXIT RULES:
- Primary exit: 2x ATR trailing stop (calculated from entry price)
- Secondary exit: When price touches opposite Bollinger Band
- Whichever condition occurs first triggers the exit

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss initially set at 2x ATR from entry point
- No trades if market is in extreme overbought/oversold conditions (RSI >70 or <30)

5. SPECIAL NOTES:
- Works best in trending markets
- Higher timeframe confirmation recommended
- Avoid using during major news events due to potential false breakouts
- Best applied to liquid assets with consistent volume patterns

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive potential when compressed volatility (Bollinger squeeze) coincides with unusual buying/selling pressure (volume surge), while using ATR-based stops to protect profits during strong moves.
