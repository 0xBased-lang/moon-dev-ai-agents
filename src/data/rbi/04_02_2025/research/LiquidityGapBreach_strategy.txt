STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityGapBreach

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility expansion and liquidity gaps by combining Bollinger Band breakouts with ATR spikes, using Keltner Channel as a mean-reversion exit signal.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies potential breakout levels
2. Average True Range (14) - Measures volatility expansion
3. Keltner Channel (20,1.5) - Provides mean-reversion exit target
4. 20-day median ATR - Establishes baseline volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Price must close outside Bollinger Band (upper or lower)
2. Current ATR must be â‰¥50% higher than 20-day median ATR
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously
4. Enter at market on next open after confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit when price retraces to Keltner Channel midline
2. Secondary exit if price reaches 2x ATR from entry point
3. Emergency exit if price reverses through opposite Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placed at 1.5x ATR from entry
3. Maximum 5 concurrent positions
4. No trading during major economic news events

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 period, 2 std dev
- ATR: 14 period
- Keltner Channel: 20 period, 1.5 multiplier
- Median ATR calculation: 20-day lookback

Additional Notes:
1. Works best on 1H-4H timeframes
2. Most effective in trending markets
3. Avoid ranging conditions (check ADX >25)
4. Combine with volume confirmation for higher accuracy

This strategy exploits the "liquidity gap" phenomenon where rapid price movements through key levels create temporary imbalances that often retrace to mean values, providing high-probability trading opportunities.
