STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Volatility Breakout System combining VWAP and Bollinger Bands
2. Volume confirmation for breakout validity
3. Dynamic threshold-based entries using historical band expansion
4. Contraction-based exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Price must cross VWAP (either direction)
2. Volume Confirmation: Surge above 20-period average volume (minimum 1.5x)
3. Band Expansion: Bollinger Band width must exceed 90th percentile of 50-period historical width
4. Direction: Long if crossing above VWAP, Short if crossing below

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When Bollinger Band width contracts below 70th percentile of recent expansion
2. Secondary Exit: Trailing stop at opposite band (longs exit at lower band, shorts at upper)
3. Time Exit: Close position after 3 bars if no contraction occurs

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial Stop: Opposite band at entry (adjusts with bands)
3. Volatility Filter: Skip trades if average true range > 3x 20-period ATR
4. Session Timing: Only trade first 2 hours of session for most active volatility

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
3. Volume (20-period average)
4. Bollinger Band Width (historical percentile)
5. Average True Range (20-period)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different historical lookback periods (30-100) for width percentiles
2. Experiment with volume surge multipliers (1.3x-2x)
3. Adjust band standard deviations (1.5-2.5) based on asset volatility
4. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., no longs above 70, no shorts below 30)

This VolumetricBandwidth strategy combines volume-confirmed volatility expansion with mean-reversion tendencies around VWAP, creating high-probability breakout trades with built-in volatility-based exits.
