STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation zone analysis with volatility expansion signals for high-probability breakout trading. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Heatmap Analysis - Identifies price zones with high cluster of liquidations (potential turning points)
2. Keltner Channels (20-period, 2xATR) - Measures volatility expansion
3. Volume-Weighted Volatility (20-period median) - Tracks market conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Identify clustered liquidation zones on heatmap (minimum 3 significant liquidation clusters)
2. Wait for price to break through liquidation zone boundary
3. Confirm breakout with:
   - Price closing outside Keltner Channel
   - Volume exceeding 20-period average
   - RSI(14) between 40-60 (neutral zone) before breakout

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When volume-weighted volatility reverts to its 20-period median
2. Secondary Exit: 
   - If price returns inside Keltner Channel
   - Or if opposing liquidation zone is reached
3. Time-based Exit: Close position after 3 periods if no exit signal triggers

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop placement: 
   - Initial: 1.5x recent average daily range
   - Trailing: Move to breakeven after 1.5x risk achieved
3. Maximum daily loss limit: 5% of account
4. Avoid trading during scheduled high-impact news events

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation Heatmap (cluster detection)
2. Keltner Channels (20,2)
3. Volume-Weighted Volatility Indicator
4. RSI (14 periods)
5. Volume Average (20 periods)

Special Notes:
- Works best on 4H and daily timeframes
- Most effective in BTC, ETH and major forex pairs
- Requires confirmation of at least 2 timeframes
- Filter trades using VWAP slope (must be in breakout direction)
