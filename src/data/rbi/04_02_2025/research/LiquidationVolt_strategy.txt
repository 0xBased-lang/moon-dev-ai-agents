STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationVolt  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cluster Levels:** Price zones where high liquidation events occur, indicating potential reversal or continuation points.  
2. **Low Volatility Filter:** Uses 14-period ATR (Average True Range) to confirm low volatility conditions before entry.  
3. **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Monitors ATR's 20-day moving average to detect breakout conditions for exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition:** Price approaches predefined liquidation cluster levels (must be identified through historical data or order flow analysis).  
- **Confirmation:** 14-period ATR must be below a set threshold (e.g., bottom 30% of its 50-day range).  
- **Action:** Enter long position when both conditions align.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Volatility Expansion:** Exit long position when current ATR exceeds its 20-day moving average, signaling increased volatility.  
- **Alternative Exit:** Consider a trailing stop or fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2) if volatility remains suppressed.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the liquidation cluster level or a recent swing low.  
- **Volatility Adjustment:** Reduce position size if ATR is abnormally low (indicating potential explosive moves).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ATR (14-period):** To measure volatility and set entry/exit thresholds.  
2. **ATR 20-day Moving Average:** To gauge volatility expansion for exits.  
3. **Liquidation Cluster Detection Tool:** Custom script or order flow data to identify high-liquidation zones.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines liquidation-based support/resistance with volatility regimes, targeting low-risk entries before high-momentum moves. Avoids choppy markets by filtering for low ATR.  

**Note:** Backtest liquidation clusters for asset-specific behavior and optimize ATR thresholds per instrument.
