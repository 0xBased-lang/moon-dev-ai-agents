STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility (contraction) when the Bollinger Band width falls below its 50-day average, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **ADX Trend Strength:** Confirms breakout validity by requiring ADX to rise above 30, ensuring strong trend momentum.  
3. **Parabolic SAR Trailing Stop:** Manages exits dynamically by trailing price movements, locking in profits while minimizing risk.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Bollinger Band width (BBW) < 50-day average of BBW (volatility contraction).  
  - Price breaks *above* the upper Bollinger Band.  
  - ADX rises above 30 (confirming strong trend strength).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Bollinger Band width (BBW) < 50-day average of BBW (volatility contraction).  
  - Price breaks *below* the lower Bollinger Band.  
  - ADX rises above 30 (confirming strong trend strength).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Parabolic SAR flips to the opposite side of the trade (e.g., SAR moves above price in a long trade).  
- **Emergency Stop:** Fixed stop-loss at 2x the average true range (ATR) from entry to limit downside risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid entries if ADX is declining or below 25 (weak trend).  
- Only trade breakouts after prolonged (>1 month) volatility contraction for higher reliability.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To identify squeeze conditions and breakout levels.  
2. **ADX (14)** – To confirm trend strength.  
3. **Parabolic SAR (0.02, 0.2)** – For trailing stop exits.  
4. **ATR (14)** – For emergency stop-loss placement.  

**Unique Edge:**  
The *VoltaicSqueeze* strategy combines low-volatility breakouts (high-probability setups) with ADX trend validation, reducing false signals. Parabolic SAR ensures adaptive risk management, making it ideal for trending markets after consolidation phases.  

**Note:** Backtest on daily/weekly charts for best results, as 1-month volatility contractions require longer timeframes.
