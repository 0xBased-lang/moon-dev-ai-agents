STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiditySqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies periods of low volatility where price is consolidating within tightening Bollinger Bands (typically using a 20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations).  
2. **On-Chain Liquidity Clusters:** Uses blockchain data to detect zones where large liquidity pools (buy/sell orders) are concentrated, acting as support/resistance.  
3. **Volatility Expansion Confirmation:** Requires a breakout from the squeeze with strong volume or price momentum to confirm the trade direction.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract (squeeze) near a liquidity cluster zone (e.g., a high volume node or order book imbalance).  
2. Enter long on a bullish breakout (price closes above upper band) or short on a bearish breakout (price closes below lower band).  
3. Confirm with additional indicators like RSI (not overbought/sold) or volume spike to validate the breakout.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. Take profit at the next opposing liquidity cluster (e.g., if long, exit near a sell-side liquidity zone).  
2. Stop loss placed just beyond the opposite Bollinger Band or the nearest liquidity cluster invalidating the trade.  
3. Trail stops if volatility continues to expand favorably.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. Stop loss must be respectedâ€”no discretionary widening.  
3. Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., weekends, holidays) to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 StdDev).  
2. On-chain liquidity data (e.g., order book heatmaps, volume profiles).  
3. Volume indicator (to confirm breakout validity).  
4. Optional: RSI (14-period) to filter overextended moves.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines technical squeeze patterns with blockchain liquidity insights for high-probability, asymmetric risk/reward setups.
