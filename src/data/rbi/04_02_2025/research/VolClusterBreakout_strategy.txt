STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines technical volatility compression patterns with on-chain liquidity analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The core approach focuses on detecting periods of extreme volatility contraction followed by expansion, while confirming with liquidation cluster alignment for additional confluence.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Percentile: Measures volatility compression by calculating the bandwidth (upper band - lower band) as a percentage of the middle band, then ranking it against historical values
2. Liquidation Heatmaps: On-chain data showing concentration of potential liquidation levels
3. Liquidity Pools: Key areas where stop orders and take-profit orders cluster

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Bollinger Band width falls below 10th percentile (extreme compression)
2. Confirmation: Price closes outside the Bollinger Bands (breakout signal)
3. Confluence: Breakout direction aligns with nearby liquidation clusters (within 2% of current price)
4. Execution: Enter on retest of breakout level or next candle open

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Nearest opposing liquidity pool (identified via heatmap)
2. Stop Loss: Opposite side of the breakout candle or beyond recent swing point
3. Time Exit: Close position if no follow-through within 3 candles

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop Placement: Minimum 1.5x average true range from entry
3. Filter: Only trade when volatility percentile <15 and >5 (avoid extreme ranging markets)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. BB Width Percentile (100-period lookback)
3. On-chain liquidation heatmap (preferably with cluster density indicators)
4. Average True Range (14-period)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 4H or daily timeframes on liquid assets
- Requires real-time on-chain data feeds
- Works particularly well during transitional market phases
- Avoid news events and low liquidity periods
- Combine with volume confirmation for higher accuracy

The unique combination of technical volatility measurement with on-chain liquidity analysis creates a robust framework for trading compression breakouts with defined risk parameters.
