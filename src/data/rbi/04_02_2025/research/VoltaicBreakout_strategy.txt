STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility measurement with volume analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The core concept revolves around capturing strong directional moves after periods of consolidation, using ATR-based bands as dynamic support/resistance levels.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: 
   - 20-period Moving Average (baseline)
   - 2x ATR (20-period) upper/lower bands (entry triggers)
   - 1x ATR (20-period) bands (exit levels)

2. Volume Filter:
   - Declining volume during consolidation period
   - Volume spike confirmation preferred but not required

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price closes above 20MA + (2x ATR)
   - Preceded by declining volume pattern
   - Consolidation period visible (at least 5 bars)

2. Short Entry:
   - Price closes below 20MA - (2x ATR)
   - Same volume/consolidation requirements as long

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking:
   - Price returns to 1x ATR band (20MA Â± ATR)
   - Trailing stop can be implemented at 1x ATR from extreme

2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop at 3x ATR from entry
   - Can be tightened to 2x ATR after favorable move

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Volatility-adjusted stops (3x ATR)
3. Avoid trading during news events (increased false breakouts)
4. Minimum 1:1 risk-reward ratio

Required Indicators:
1. 20-period Moving Average (any type)
2. 20-period Average True Range (ATR)
3. Volume indicator (preferably OBV or simple volume)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets with clear consolidation
- Higher timeframe breakouts (4H/Daily) more reliable
- Avoid during low volatility periods (compressed ATR)

Enhancement Suggestions:
1. Add RSI filter (e.g., only trade if RSI <70 for longs >30 for shorts)
2. Combine with ADX >25 for stronger trend confirmation
3. Use multiple timeframe confirmation (e.g., 4H breakout on Daily trend)

This "VoltaicBreakout" strategy excels in capturing explosive moves after periods of compression, with the volume filter helping avoid false breakouts. The ATR-based exits allow for dynamic profit-taking that adapts to changing volatility conditions.
