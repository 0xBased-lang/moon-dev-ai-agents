STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelForce Divergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Components:
1. Donchian Channel Breakout: Uses 20-period Donchian Channel to identify potential breakout levels
2. Elder Force Index Confirmation: Requires a surge in the Elder Force Index to validate breakout momentum
3. RSI Divergence Filter: Uses 4-hour RSI divergence against the prevailing trend as a confirming filter

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to break above/below the 20-period Donchian Channel (upper/lower band)
2. Confirm Elder Force Index shows significant surge in buying/selling pressure
3. Verify 4-hour RSI shows divergence against the prevailing trend (bullish divergence in downtrend or bearish divergence in uptrend)
4. Enter long on bullish breakout or short on bearish breakout when all conditions align

Exit Rules:
1. Close position when price crosses the opposite Donchian band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs)
2. Alternative exit when Elder Force Index shows opposite momentum surge
3. Consider partial profits when price reaches 1.5x the Donchian Channel width

Risk Management:
1. Set stop-loss just beyond the opposite Donchian band
2. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts
4. Maximum of 3 concurrent positions open

Required Indicators:
1. 20-period Donchian Channel (shows breakout levels)
2. Elder Force Index (13-period recommended, confirms momentum)
3. 4-hour RSI (14-period recommended, detects divergences)
4. Price chart with clear trend identification

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets, avoid ranging conditions
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation
- Requires patience as setups may take time to develop
- Backtest optimal Donchian period for specific instruments
