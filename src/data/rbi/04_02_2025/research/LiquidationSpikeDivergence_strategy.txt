STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationSpikeDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Volume Spike (2σ Threshold):** The strategy identifies abnormal liquidation activity by detecting spikes in hourly liquidation volumes that exceed 2 standard deviations (σ) from the mean. This suggests extreme market conditions where forced liquidations may lead to reversals.  
2. **Bullish RSI Divergence:** Confirms entry signals when price makes a lower low while the RSI (14-period) makes a higher low, indicating weakening downward momentum.  
3. **Chande’s Kroll Volatility-Adjusted Exit:** Uses the Chande-Kroll Stop indicator to dynamically adjust profit targets based on market volatility, ensuring exits adapt to changing conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Trigger:** A 2σ spike in hourly liquidation volume.  
- **Confirmation:** Bullish RSI divergence (price lower low, RSI higher low) on the same hourly candle or the next.  
- **Entry Point:** Enter long at the close of the candle confirming the RSI divergence.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit when price reaches the upper Chande-Kroll Stop band (volatility-adjusted).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place initial stop-loss below the most recent swing low or at a fixed risk percentage (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on stop-loss distance (e.g., risking 1% per trade).  
- Avoid trading during scheduled high-impact news events to prevent false spikes.  
- Maximum daily drawdown limit (e.g., 5%).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Liquidation volume data (exchange-specific or aggregated from APIs like Coinglass).  
2. RSI (14-period) for divergence detection.  
3. Chande-Kroll Stop (default settings: 10-period ATR, 3x multiplier).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines liquidation-driven mean reversion with momentum confirmation (RSI divergence) and adaptive exits, targeting overextended markets where forced selling creates reversal opportunities.  

**Note:** Backtest for optimal σ threshold (2σ may vary by asset) and validate across multiple crypto assets with high liquidation sensitivity (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL).
