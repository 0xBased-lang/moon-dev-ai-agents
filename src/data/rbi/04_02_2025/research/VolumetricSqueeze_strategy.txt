STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines volume confirmation (OBV) with volatility contraction (Bollinger Bands)
- Focuses on breakout potential during low volatility periods
- Uses adaptive exit mechanism based on volatility expansion

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width contraction (20-period SMA, 2Ïƒ)
- Confirmation: Positive OBV divergence (price making lower lows while OBV makes higher lows)
- Execution: Enter long when both conditions are met

3. Exit Rules:
- Dynamic Trailing Stop: 1.5x ATR(14) from recent high
- Exit Trigger: Price closes below trailing stop level
- Additional Exit: Consider closing if Bollinger Band width expands beyond squeeze threshold

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on ATR (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade)
- Stop placement automatically adjusts to market volatility
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Average True Range (14-period)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1H-4H timeframes
- Works well in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Requires confirmation from price action near squeeze breakout
- Avoid using in strongly trending markets without pullbacks

The VolumetricSqueeze strategy uniquely combines volume confirmation with volatility contraction signals, creating a high-probability breakout system with dynamic risk management. The name reflects both the volume analysis (Volumetric) and the Bollinger Band squeeze setup (Squeeze).
