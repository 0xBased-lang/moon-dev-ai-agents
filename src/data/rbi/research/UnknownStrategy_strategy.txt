STRATEGY\_NAME: ATR\_MomentumReversion

STRATEGY\_DETAILS:

This strategy focuses on trading mean reversion by identifying overextended instruments using Average True Range (ATR) and Keltner Channels. The key components of this strategy are:

1. Identifying overextended instruments:
   - Calculate the ATR value for the instrument.
   - Use Keltner Channels with a period of 20 and a multiplier of 2.5.
   - If price moves beyond the upper or lower channel, it could form a mean reversion trade.

2. Entry rules:
   - Look for a 2B price pattern:
     - Price runs up or down and breaks the channel or band.
     - A slight retracement occurs, bringing new longs into the action.
     - A reversal candlestick takes place.
   - Place a sell stop (for long trades) or buy stop (for short trades) below the reversal candle.

3. Exit rules:
   - Use a protective stop loss beyond the high (for long trades) or low (for short trades) of the reversal candle.

4. Risk management:
   - Consider using half of your normal size for these trades, as there might be another poke above or below as different time frames react to the event.

5. Required indicators:
   - Average True Range (ATR)
   - Keltner Channels (20 periods, multiplier of 2.5)

The strategy aims to trade against the trend with a reversion to the mean approach but requires a proper setup to increase the odds of success. Traders should look for an overextended instrument and follow the 2B price pattern entry rules to manage risk and lock in profits during trend moves.
