STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicValidation

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This strategy, named "DynamicValidation," focuses on identifying market structure, supply and demand zones, and implementing a risk-reward ratio to ensure profitable trades. The unique aspect of this strategy is its dynamic validation of lows and highs to determine the overall trend.

1. Key strategy components:
   - Market structure analysis to identify uptrends and downtrends.
   - Supply and demand zone identification for entry points.
   - Risk-reward ratio management.

2. Entry/exit rules:
   - Enter long positions in uptrends when price reenters a demand zone. Set the stop loss just below the demand zone and the take profit at recent highs.
   - Enter short positions in downtrends when price reenters a supply zone. Set the stop loss just above the supply zone and the take profit at recent lows.

3. Risk management:
   - Only take trades if the risk-reward ratio is above 2.5:1, meaning you risk $1 for every $2.5 gained.

4. Required indicators:
   - None. This strategy relies on pure price action, identifying highs, lows, and consolidation areas.

Follow these steps to implement the DynamicValidation strategy:

1. Analyze the market structure to determine if you're in an uptrend or downtrend.
2. Identify valid lows and highs based on the dynamic validation rule.
3. Mark demand zones in uptrends and supply zones in downtrends.
4. Wait for price to reenter the zones for entry points.
5. Set appropriate stop loss and take profit levels.
6. Ensure the risk-reward ratio is above 2.5:1 before entering a trade.
