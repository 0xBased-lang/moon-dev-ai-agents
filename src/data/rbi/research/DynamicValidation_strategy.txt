STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicValidation

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This strategy, named "DynamicValidation," focuses on market structure, supply and demand zones, and risk-reward management. It does not rely on traditional indicators or patterns but instead uses price action to identify trends and trade opportunities.

1. Market Structure and Trend Identification:
   - An uptrend is characterized by higher highs and higher lows.
   - A downtrend is characterized by lower lows and lower highs.
   - A low is considered valid only if it breaks the previous high.
   - When price breaks a valid low, the new low is transferred to the breakout point.

2. Supply and Demand Zones:
   - Demand zones are identified in uptrends, and supply zones are identified in downtrends.
   - Buy from demand zones and sell from supply zones.
   - Demand zones are marked by finding an area of consolidation or a point where price moves sideways before a sharp move upward.
   - Supply zones are marked by finding an area of consolidation or a point where price moves sideways before a sharp move downward.

3. Entry Rules:
   - Enter a long trade when price re-enters a demand zone.
   - Set the stop loss right below the demand zone.
   - Set the take profit at recent highs.
   - Enter a short trade when price re-enters a supply zone in a downtrend.
   - Set the stop loss right above the supply zone.
   - Set the take profit at recent lows.

4. Risk Management:
   - Only take trades if the risk-reward ratio is above 2.5:1. This means that for every $100 risked, you aim to make $250 or more.

5. Required Tools:
   - A charting platform with rectangle drawing tools.

In summary, the DynamicValidation strategy involves understanding market structure, identifying supply and demand zones, and employing a strict risk-reward management system. By focusing on these key components, traders can potentially increase their profitability and make calculated trades in the financial markets.
