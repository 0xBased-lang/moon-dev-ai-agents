### Strategy Instructions for Backtesting

#### 1. **Key Strategy Components**
   - **Timeframe**: Use a 15-minute chart for intraday trading.
   - **Market**: Focus on highly liquid assets (e.g., major forex pairs, indices, or large-cap stocks).
   - **Objective**: Capture short-term price movements using a combination of trend-following and momentum indicators.

#### 2. **Entry Rules**
   - **Trend Confirmation**:
     - Use the **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** to determine the overall trend.
       - **Long Entry**: Price must be above the 200 EMA.
       - **Short Entry**: Price must be below the 200 EMA.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**:
     - Use the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** (14-period) to confirm momentum.
       - **Long Entry**: RSI must be above 50 and rising.
       - **Short Entry**: RSI must be below 50 and falling.
   - **Candlestick Pattern**:
     - Look for a bullish engulfing pattern for long entries or a bearish engulfing pattern for short entries.
   - **Volume Confirmation**:
     - Ensure volume is above the 20-period average volume for the entry candle.

#### 3. **Exit Rules**
   - **Take Profit**:
     - Set a fixed take profit at 1.5 times the Average True Range (ATR) (14-period) from the entry price.
   - **Stop Loss**:
     - Place a stop loss at 1 times the ATR (14-period) from the entry price.
   - **Trailing Stop**:
     - Use a trailing stop of 0.5 times the ATR (14-period) once the price moves in your favor by 1 ATR.
   - **Time-Based Exit**:
     - Exit the trade if the target or stop loss is not hit within 4 hours of entry.

#### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Position Sizing**:
     - Risk no more than 1% of your trading capital on any single trade.
     - Calculate position size based on the distance between entry price and stop loss.
   - **Maximum Daily Loss**:
     - Stop trading for the day if you incur a 3% loss of your total account balance.
   - **Maximum Daily Trades**:
     - Limit yourself to 5 trades per day to avoid overtrading.

#### 5. **Required Indicators**
   - **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
     - Used to identify the overall trend.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14-period)**:
     - Used to confirm momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **Average True Range (ATR) (14-period)**:
     - Used to set stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop levels.
   - **Volume Indicator**:
     - Used to confirm entry signals with above-average volume.

#### 6. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - **Data Range**: Use at least 6 months of historical data.
   - **Slippage**: Assume 0.1% slippage per trade.
   - **Commission**: Include a $5 commission per trade (if applicable).
   - **Initial Capital**: Start with $10,000 for simulation purposes.

#### 7. **Additional Notes**
   - Ensure the strategy is tested across different market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile, and low-volatility periods).
   - Record and analyze win rate, average profit/loss per trade, and drawdowns during backtesting.
