STRATEGY_NAME: Momentum Divergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

Key Strategy Components:
1. Uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a momentum indicator, rather than a traditional overbought/oversold signal.
2. Focuses on identifying divergences between the price action and the RSI trend.
3. Removes the standard overbought (70) and oversold (30) levels, instead using the 50 level as a reference point for trend direction.
4. Confirms the strategy's signals by combining the RSI with the 200-period moving average to trade in the direction of the overall trend.

Entry/Exit Rules:
- Entry: Look for a divergence between the price action and the RSI, where the price is making lower lows but the RSI is making higher lows (bullish divergence) or vice versa (bearish divergence).
- Confirm the entry by ensuring the RSI is below the 50 level for a bearish trade or above the 50 level for a bullish trade, and the price is below/above the 200-period moving average.
- Exit: Close the trade when the divergence is resolved, and/or the RSI crosses back above/below the 50 level in the opposite direction.

Risk Management:
- Use appropriate position sizing based on your risk tolerance and account size.
- Place stop-loss orders at key support/resistance levels, or a fixed percentage of your account, to limit downside risk.
- Consider using trailing stops to protect profits as the trade progresses.

Required Indicators:
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- 200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)

This strategy focuses on identifying and trading momentum divergences, rather than relying solely on traditional overbought/oversold signals from the RSI. By combining the RSI with the 200-period moving average, it aims to capture stronger trends and avoid being whipsawed by false signals. The key is to use the RSI as a momentum indicator and look for divergences that signal a potential shift in the underlying trend.
