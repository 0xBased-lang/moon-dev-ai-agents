STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumOscillator

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

This strategy, called MomentumOscillator, focuses on using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a momentum indicator rather than an overbought/oversold oscillator. The main components of this strategy are:

1. Key strategy components:
- RSI indicator with a 14-period setting
- Moving averages (preferably 200-period) for trend identification

2. Entry rules:
- Enter a short position when the RSI is below the 50-line and moving downwards, indicating a downtrend
- Enter a long position when the RSI is above the 50-line and moving upwards, indicating an uptrend

3. Exit rules:
- Exit the short position when the RSI crosses above the 50-line, indicating an uptrend
- Exit the long position when the RSI crosses below the 50-line, indicating a downtrend

4. Risk management:
- Set stop-loss levels based on support and resistance levels or the recent price action
- Adjust position size according to your risk tolerance and the volatility of the asset

5. Required indicators:
- Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a 14-period setting
- Moving averages (200-period recommended)

The MomentumOscillator strategy emphasizes using the RSI as a momentum indicator instead of the traditional overbought/oversold levels at 70 and 30. By removing these levels and focusing on the direction of the RSI, this strategy aims to avoid false signals and improve trading performance.
