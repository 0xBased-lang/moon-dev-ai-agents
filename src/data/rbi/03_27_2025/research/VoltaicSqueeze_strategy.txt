STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with RSI momentum and ATR-based exits to capitalize on volatility compression breakouts.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Measures volatility contraction
2. RSI (14) - Confirms momentum direction
3. ATR (14) - Determines dynamic exit points
4. 30-day lookback period - Identifies significant squeeze conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width (Upper-Lower) must be at its narrowest point in the last 30 trading days
2. Confirmation: RSI must be above 50 (indicating bullish momentum)
3. Entry: Long position triggered when both conditions are met on closing price

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 2x ATR (14-period) from entry price (measured from close to close)
2. Stop Loss: None explicitly defined (exit purely based on ATR target)
3. Alternative Exit: Consider closing if Bollinger Bands expand beyond 30-day average width

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR move as potential profit target
2. No stop loss means potential for larger drawdowns - consider adding:
   - Trailing stop based on ATR
   - Time-based exit if target not hit within X days
3. Volatility filter: Consider only trading when overall market VIX is below certain threshold

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations
- RSI: 14-period
- ATR: 14-period
- Bollinger Band width calculation: (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band

Optimization Considerations:
1. Test different RSI thresholds (e.g., 45-55 range)
2. Experiment with ATR multiples (1.5x-3x)
3. Evaluate different lookback periods for squeeze identification (20-50 days)
4. Consider adding volume confirmation for breakouts

Unique Advantages:
1. Captures explosive moves after periods of low volatility
2. Uses multiple confirmation factors (volatility + momentum)
3. Dynamic exit adapts to current market conditions
4. Works well in trending markets after consolidation periods

Potential Weaknesses:
1. May experience whipsaws in ranging markets
2. No stop loss could lead to larger losses
3. Requires sufficient volatility contraction to trigger entries
4. Performance depends on proper ATR multiple selection
