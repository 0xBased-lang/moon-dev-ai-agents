STRATEGY_NAME: FundingVwapRejection

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines funding rate analysis with volume-weighted price action and Bollinger Band dynamics for short entries in perpetual futures markets. The approach specifically targets overextended bullish conditions when they show signs of exhaustion.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Threshold: Uses +0.1% as the trigger level indicating excessive long positioning
2. Weekly VWAP Clusters: Identifies significant volume-based resistance zones
3. Price Rejection: Requires bearish price action at VWAP clusters (pin bars, engulfing patterns)
4. Bollinger Band Liquidity: Daily bands (typically 20-period, 2 std dev) mark potential exit zones

Entry Rules:
1. Confirm perpetual funding rate > +0.1% (indicating crowded long trade)
2. Identify price rejection candle(s) at weekly VWAP cluster (minimum 2 touches)
3. Enter short on break below rejection candle low
4. Ideal entry shows wick rejection with high volume at VWAP

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When funding rate normalizes to â‰¤ +0.05%
2. Secondary Exit: Price sweeps below daily Bollinger Band lower band
3. Emergency Exit: If funding rate spikes beyond +0.3% (indicates potential short squeeze)

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop Loss: Above recent swing high or VWAP cluster top
3. Time Filter: Avoid entering last 2 hours before funding rate calculation
4. Asset Selection: Focus on top 5 volume perpetual contracts

Required Indicators:
1. Perpetual Funding Rate (real-time)
2. Weekly VWAP with cluster detection
3. Daily Bollinger Bands (20,2)
4. Volume indicator (confirming rejection candles)

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust funding rate threshold based on asset volatility (crypto vs commodities)
2. Test different VWAP timeframes (monthly vs weekly)
3. Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., >60 when entering)
