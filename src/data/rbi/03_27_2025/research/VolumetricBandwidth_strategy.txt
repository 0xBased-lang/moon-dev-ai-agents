STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-confirmed momentum with volatility contraction patterns for high-probability mean reversion trades. The unique combination of Volume-Weighted RSI divergence and Bollinger Bandwidth contraction creates a powerful filter for identifying potential reversal points during periods of compressed volatility.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted RSI (14-period) - Identifies momentum extremes with volume confirmation
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) - Measures volatility and price extremes
3. Bollinger Bandwidth - Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band
4. Volume - 50-period moving average as reference for "above-average" threshold

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Bollinger Bandwidth must be below its 20-period average (contraction phase)
2. Price touches or crosses below lower Bollinger Band
3. Volume exceeds 50-period moving average
4. Volume-Weighted RSI shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low)

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Bollinger Bandwidth must be below its 20-period average (contraction phase)
2. Price touches or crosses above upper Bollinger Band
3. Volume exceeds 50-period moving average
4. Volume-Weighted RSI shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit when price reaches opposite Bollinger Band
2. Secondary exit if Volume-Weighted RSI crosses back above 30 (for longs) or below 70 (for shorts)
3. Emergency exit if price closes beyond 2.5 std dev from middle band

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placed at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width from entry
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 3%
4. No new entries if Bandwidth > 20-period average

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted RSI (14-period)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
3. Bollinger Bandwidth
4. Volume MA (50-period)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different RSI periods (10-20) for various instruments
- Adjust std dev parameters (1.8-2.2) based on asset volatility
- Consider adding MACD confirmation for stronger signals
- Works best on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trading

This strategy excels in ranging markets and during volatility contraction periods, using volume as confirmation to avoid false breakouts. The Volume-Weighted RSI divergence adds an additional layer of confirmation to traditional Bollinger Band strategies.
