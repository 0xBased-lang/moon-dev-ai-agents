STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinBandSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines the Chaikin Oscillator, Bollinger Band width contraction, and a moving average crossover to identify high-probability breakout trades with controlled risk.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Chaikin Oscillator**: Measures accumulation/distribution momentum.  
2. **50-period SMA of Chaikin Oscillator**: Smooths the oscillator for trend confirmation.  
3. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction**: Identifies low volatility conditions (squeeze) when width falls below its 20-day percentile.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  1. Bollinger Band width contracts below its 20-day percentile (volatility squeeze).  
  2. Chaikin Oscillator crosses **above** its 50-period SMA (bullish momentum confirmation).  

- Go **SHORT** when:  
  1. Bollinger Band width contracts below its 20-day percentile.  
  2. Chaikin Oscillator crosses **below** its 50-period SMA (bearish momentum confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close LONG position when Chaikin Oscillator crosses **below** its 50-period SMA.  
- Close SHORT position when Chaikin Oscillator crosses **above** its 50-period SMA.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss at recent swing low (for long) or swing high (for short).  
- Use a trailing stop based on ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) to lock in profits.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Chaikin Oscillator (default settings).  
2. 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the Chaikin Oscillator.  
3. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).  
4. Bollinger Band Width (20-day percentile filter).  

**Unique Edge:**  
The strategy capitalizes on breakout opportunities emerging from low volatility (Bollinger squeeze) while using Chaikin Oscillator crossover to confirm momentum shifts, reducing false signals.
