STRATEGY_NAME: CrossfireBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The CrossfireBreakout strategy combines trend confirmation, momentum strength, and volatility-based exits for high-probability breakout trades. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Trend Identification: Uses the 50/200 EMA crossover as primary trend filter
- Momentum Confirmation: Requires ADX > 25 to validate trend strength
- Volatility Management: Uses ATR for dynamic stop placement
- Exit Signals: Combines overbought/oversold RSI with volatility stops

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Long Entry:
  * 50 EMA crosses ABOVE 200 EMA (Golden Cross)
  * ADX rises above 25 (confirming trend strength)
  * Enter on first bullish candle after conditions met

- Short Entry:
  * 50 EMA crosses BELOW 200 EMA (Death Cross)
  * ADX rises above 25 (confirming trend strength)
  * Enter on first bearish candle after conditions met

3. EXIT RULES:
- Stop-Loss: 
  * 2x ATR from entry price (volatility-adjusted)
  * Trailed daily using closing prices

- Profit Taking:
  * Close long when 5-period RSI > 70 (overbought)
  * Close short when 5-period RSI < 30 (oversold)
  * Alternative exit when opposite EMA crossover occurs

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop-loss is mandatory on all positions
- No new entries when ADX < 20 (choppy market filter)
- Avoid trading during major economic news events

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Average Directional Index (ADX) 14-period
- Average True Range (ATR) 14-period
- Relative Strength Index (RSI) 5-period

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Test different EMA periods (e.g., 21/55) for various markets
- Adjust ADX threshold (20-30 range) based on volatility
- Consider using 1.5-3x ATR for stop placement
- May add volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy works best on daily charts of liquid assets with strong trending characteristics. The combination of trend confirmation (EMA cross), momentum (ADX), and smart exits (ATR/RSI) creates a robust framework for capturing sustained moves while limiting downside risk.
