STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume confirmation with volatility contraction to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The core premise relies on the convergence of three key elements: OBV divergence, Keltner Channel squeeze, and price breakout confirmation.

Key Components:
1. On-Balance Volume (OBV) - Must reach a 20-day high
2. Keltner Channel - Must show contraction/squeeze pattern
3. Price Action - Must break channel boundaries after conditions are met

Indicator Requirements:
- Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2.0 ATR multiplier)
- On-Balance Volume (standard calculation)
- 20-day high/low reference points

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for OBV to reach a 20-day high (bullish confirmation)
2. Identify when Keltner Channel width contracts to below average levels (squeeze)
3. Enter long when price breaks above upper Keltner Channel
4. Enter short when price breaks below lower Keltner Channel

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Exit when price closes below Keltner midline
2. For short positions: Exit when price closes above Keltner midline
3. Alternative exit: When OBV shows opposite 20-day extreme

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on channel width at entry (wider channels = smaller position)
2. Initial stop placed at opposite channel boundary
3. Trailing stop option: Move to breakeven when price reaches 1.5x channel width
4. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital

Optimization Notes:
- Test different ATR multipliers (1.5-2.5 range) for channel sensitivity
- Experiment with OBV lookback periods (15-25 days)
- Consider adding volume filter (e.g., breakout must occur on above-average volume)

This strategy works best in markets transitioning from low to high volatility, using OBV peaks to confirm genuine accumulation/distribution before the volatility expansion signaled by the channel breakout. The combination of volume confirmation with volatility contraction provides a robust filter against false breakouts.
