STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume confirmation to identify potential explosive breakout opportunities, using an adaptive trailing stop for exit management.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures periods of low volatility when the bands tighten significantly
2. Volume Confirmation: Requires substantial buying interest to validate the breakout signal
3. Adaptive Exit: Uses volatility-based trailing stop to lock in profits during strong trends

Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: Bollinger Band Width (20,2) reaches a 10-day low (indicating extreme contraction)
- Confirmation: Volume must spike above 2x the 20-day average volume
- Execution: Enter long position at market when both conditions are met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
- Trailing Stop: Set at 2x the 14-period Average True Range (ATR)
- The stop trails below the highest price reached since entry
- No profit target - let the trailing stop determine the exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop could be set at 1.5x ATR below entry if not using pure trailing stop
3. Volatility Filter: Avoid trading when 14-period ATR is below its 20-day average (low volatility periods)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for width calculation
2. Volume (20-day average and current)
3. Average True Range (14-period)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in markets transitioning from consolidation to trending phases
- Most effective on daily or 4-hour timeframes
- Consider combining with RSI (2) < 20 for additional oversold confirmation
- Avoid using during major news events when volume spikes may be misleading

Optimization Considerations:
- Test different lookback periods for BB Width low (5-20 days)
- Experiment with volume multipliers (1.5x-3x average)
- Adjust ATR multiplier for trailing stop (1.5x-3x) based on market volatility
