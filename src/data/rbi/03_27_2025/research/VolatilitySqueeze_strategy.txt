STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Focus:** This strategy specifically targets shorting volatility when extreme conditions are met, leveraging the relationship between the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and the VVIX (VIX of VIX).  
2. **Bollinger Band Trigger:** The VIX must close above its 20-day Bollinger Band, indicating an overextended move in volatility.  
3. **VVIX Confirmation:** The VVIX must be in its 90th percentile historical range, confirming heightened fear or uncertainty in the market.  
4. **Exit Signal:** The trade is exited when the VIX crosses below its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), signaling a potential decline in volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The VIX closes above its upper 20-day Bollinger Band (typically set at 2 standard deviations).  
- **Condition 2:** The VVIX is in its 90th percentile historical range (calculated over a sufficiently long lookback period, e.g., 1-2 years).  
- **Action:** Initiate a short volatility position (e.g., via VIX futures, options, or volatility ETFs like SVXY).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Condition:** The VIX crosses below its 20-day SMA.  
- **Action:** Close the short volatility position to lock in profits or limit losses.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate a conservative portion of the portfolio (e.g., 1-3%) to this strategy due to the high-risk nature of shorting volatility.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Implement a stop-loss if the VIX continues to rise (e.g., exit if the VIX closes above the upper Bollinger Band again or if the VVIX reaches a new extreme percentile).  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Consider exiting after a set period (e.g., 5-10 trading days) if the exit condition isnâ€™t met, to avoid prolonged exposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VIX (CBOE Volatility Index):** Primary indicator for volatility levels.  
2. **20-Day Bollinger Bands for VIX:** Upper band (typically +2 standard deviations) to identify overbought conditions.  
3. **VVIX (VIX of VIX):** Measures volatility of the VIX itself; historical percentile is critical for confirmation.  
4. **20-Day SMA for VIX:** Simple moving average used for exit signals.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in mean-reverting volatility environments and may underperform during prolonged volatility spikes.  
- Backtesting should include stress periods (e.g., 2008, 2020) to assess robustness.  
- Consider combining with other indicators (e.g., VIX term structure) for additional confirmation.
