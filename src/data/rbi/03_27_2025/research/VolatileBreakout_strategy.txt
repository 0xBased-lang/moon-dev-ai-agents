STRATEGY_NAME: VolatileBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines trend confirmation with volatility and volume filters to identify high-probability breakout trades. The key components are:  

1. **Trend Confirmation**:  
   - The 50-period EMA must cross above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) to confirm a bullish trend.  
   - The 50-period EMA must cross below the 200-period EMA (Death Cross) to confirm a bearish trend.  

2. **Volatility Filter**:  
   - The Average True Range (ATR) must be in a low range (e.g., below its 20-period moving average) to indicate a potential breakout from consolidation.  

3. **Volume Confirmation**:  
   - Volume must spike to at least 2x the 20-day average volume to confirm strong participation in the breakout.  

**Entry Rules**:  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. 50 EMA > 200 EMA (Golden Cross).  
  2. ATR is below its 20-period moving average (low volatility).  
  3. Volume exceeds 2x the 20-day average volume.  
  4. Enter on the breakout candle closing above a recent high (e.g., previous 5-period high).  

- **Short Entry**:  
  1. 50 EMA < 200 EMA (Death Cross).  
  2. ATR is below its 20-period moving average (low volatility).  
  3. Volume exceeds 2x the 20-day average volume.  
  4. Enter on the breakout candle closing below a recent low (e.g., previous 5-period low).  

**Exit Rules**:  
- **Take Profit**:  
  - Use a multiple of ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
  - Alternatively, exit when the 50 EMA crosses back below/above the 200 EMA.  

- **Stop Loss**:  
  - Place stop loss below the recent swing low (for long) or above the recent swing high (for short).  
  - Alternatively, use 1x ATR from the entry price.  

**Risk Management**:  
- Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Adjust position size based on stop-loss distance.  

**Required Indicators**:  
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
3. Average True Range (ATR) with a 20-period moving average.  
4. Volume with a 20-day average.  

This strategy is designed to capitalize on breakouts with strong trend, volume, and volatility confirmation, reducing false signals.
