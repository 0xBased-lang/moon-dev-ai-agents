STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated contrarian strategy that combines liquidation cluster analysis with cross-exchange funding rate divergence to identify high-probability reversal points. The strategy operates on the principle that concentrated liquidity zones become dynamic support/resistance levels, and extreme funding rate disparities signal potential market exhaustion.

Key Components:
1. Dynamic Liquidation Heatmap: 
   - Tracks cumulative liquidation clusters across timeframes
   - Identifies high-density zones that act as strong support/resistance
   - Adjusts levels based on recent market volatility (ATR-based scaling)

2. Cross-Exchange Funding Divergence:
   - Monitors funding rates across 3+ major exchanges
   - Requires minimum 2 standard deviation spread between highest and lowest funding
   - Confirms with volume-weighted average funding rate crossing threshold

Entry Rules (Long Example):
1. Price must breach lower liquidation cluster boundary (support)
2. Concurrent funding rate divergence spike (minimum 2σ spread)
3. Volume confirmation (minimum 1.5x 20-period average)
4. Entry on close of first candle showing rejection of breached level

Exit Rules:
1. Take-profit at next significant liquidation cluster (1:2 RR minimum)
2. Stop-loss placed beyond opposite side of breached cluster
3. Emergency exit if funding divergence collapses below 1σ spread

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on cluster density (higher density = larger position)
2. Maximum 2% risk per trade
3. Daily loss limit of 5%
4. Cooling period after 3 consecutive losses

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation heatmap (cluster density analyzer)
2. Multi-exchange funding rate monitor
3. Volume oscillator (for confirmation)
4. Volatility-adjusted ATR (for dynamic level scaling)

Optimization Notes:
- Best performance on 4h-1d timeframes
- Requires liquid markets with robust funding rate data
- Most effective during high volatility regimes
- Backtest across multiple market cycles for validation

This strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency to overextend beyond liquidation clusters when funding becomes unsustainable, creating high-probability mean-reversion opportunities. The cross-exchange confirmation filter helps avoid false signals from single-exchange anomalies.
