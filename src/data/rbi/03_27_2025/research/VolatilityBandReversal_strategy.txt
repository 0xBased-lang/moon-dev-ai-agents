STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBandReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **VIX/VVIX Ratio Analysis:** The strategy focuses on the ratio between the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and the VVIX (VIX of VIX), which measures the volatility of volatility.  
2. **Bollinger Band Breakout:** A 30-day Bollinger Band (typically set at 2 standard deviations) is applied to the VIX/VVIX ratio to identify extreme deviations.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** SPX (S&P 500) options volume is used to confirm the signal, ensuring the reversal is supported by market activity.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Long Entry (Volatility Spike Reversal):**  
   - When the VIX/VVIX ratio **closes above the upper Bollinger Band**, indicating extreme volatility compression.  
   - Confirm with **above-average SPX options volume** (e.g., 20% higher than the 10-day moving average).  
   - Enter a long position in VIX futures (or VIX-related ETFs like VXX) at the next open.  

2. **Short Entry (Volatility Collapse Reversal):**  
   - When the VIX/VVIX ratio **closes below the lower Bollinger Band**, signaling excessive complacency.  
   - Confirm with **unusually low SPX options volume** (e.g., 20% below the 10-day moving average).  
   - Enter a short position in VIX futures (or inverse VIX ETFs like SVIX) at the next open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take-Profit:**  
   - For long trades, exit when the VIX/VVIX ratio **reverts to its 30-day moving average**.  
   - For short trades, exit when the VIX/VVIX ratio **returns to its 30-day moving average**.  
2. **Stop-Loss:**  
   - Set a **5% trailing stop** from the entry price to protect against adverse moves.  
   - Alternatively, exit if the ratio **extends further beyond the Bollinger Band** (e.g., exceeding 3 standard deviations).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate no more than **2-3% of capital per trade** due to the high volatility of VIX futures.  
2. **Avoid Overnight Gaps:** Consider closing positions before major economic events to mitigate gap risk.  
3. **Correlation Check:** Monitor SPX price actionâ€”avoid trades if the broader market is in a strong trend that contradicts the signal.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **VIX/VVIX Ratio** (real-time data from CBOE or brokers).  
2. **30-day Bollinger Bands** (2 standard deviations).  
3. **SPX Options Volume** (compared to a 10-day moving average).  
4. **30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)** of the VIX/VVIX ratio for mean reversion exits.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **volatility-of-volatility (VVIX) with SPX options flow** for high-probability reversals.  
- Uses **Bollinger Bands on a ratio** rather than raw price, reducing false signals.  
- Focuses on **regime shifts** rather than short-term noise.  

**Best For:**  
- Traders comfortable with **volatility products** (futures, ETFs).  
- Intermediate to advanced traders who understand **VIX dynamics**.  
- Works best in **mean-reverting volatility environments**, not strong trending regimes.
