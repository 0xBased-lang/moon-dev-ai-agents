STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicAccumulationBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted price analysis with breakout confirmation and volatility-based exits, creating a sophisticated approach to capturing trending moves during accumulation phases.

Key Components:
1. Dynamic VWAP Envelope - Acts as the primary breakout filter
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) - Confirms accumulation before breakout
3. Bollinger Bands - Measures volatility for exit signals
4. Historical Volatility Percentiles - Provides context for current volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to CLOSE outside the dynamic VWAP envelope (upper for long, lower for short)
2. OBV must show higher highs (for long) or lower lows (for short) confirming accumulation
3. Volume on breakout candle should exceed 20-period average

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When Bollinger Band width expands beyond the 90th percentile of its 100-period historical range
2. Secondary Exit: Price closes back inside VWAP envelope
3. Emergency Exit: If OBV reverses direction sharply (3% move against position)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at opposite side of VWAP envelope
3. Trailing stop activates after price moves 1.5x initial risk, trailing at 50% of recent volatility

Required Indicators:
1. Dynamic VWAP Envelope (VWAP Â± 2 standard deviations of 20-period VWAP)
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) with 5-period smoothing
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width measurement
4. Historical Volatility Percentile (100-period lookback)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust VWAP envelope standard deviations based on asset volatility (1.5-2.5 typical range)
- Test different OBV smoothing periods (3-7) for different timeframes
- Consider adding a time filter (e.g., only trade first 4 hours of session for day trades)

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear accumulation phases, using volume confirmation to filter false breakouts and volatility expansion to capture maximum moves while protecting profits.
