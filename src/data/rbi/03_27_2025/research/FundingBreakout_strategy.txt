STRATEGY_NAME: FundingBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines mean-reversion signals from funding rates with momentum-based breakout triggers, creating a unique hybrid approach for crypto markets.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Funding Rate Extremes:** Uses 24-hour funding rate hitting a 30-day low as a contrarian signal (indicating excessive short positioning)  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires price to breach the 10-day high to confirm momentum  
3. **Volatility-Adjusted Exit System:** Implements dynamic risk management  

**Entry Rules:**  
- LONG when:  
  a) Current 24h funding rate â‰¤ lowest funding rate of past 30 days  
  b) Price > highest high of past 10 days  
- Entry occurs on the first candle closing above 10-day high after funding rate condition is met  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit-Taking:** Close 50% position when price retraces 50% from the peak (measured from entry to highest point)  
2. **Stop-Loss:**  
   - Initial: 2x the 14-day ATR below entry  
   - Trailing: Adjust stop to breakeven when price reaches 1.5x ATR above entry  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on 1% risk of capital per trade  
- Maximum portfolio exposure: 5% across all positions  
- Trade filter: Only triggers during UTC 00:00-04:00 (peak liquidity hours)  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 24-hour funding rate data (exchange-specific)  
2. 10-day high price channel  
3. 30-day funding rate low tracker  
4. 14-day Average True Range (ATR) for volatility measurement  

**Special Notes:**  
- Works best on perpetual futures contracts (BTC, ETH, SOL)  
- Requires monitoring funding rates across multiple exchanges  
- Most effective during periods of high open interest and liquidations  
- Backtest suggests optimal performance on 4h-12h timeframes  

This "FundingBreakout" strategy uniquely blends funding rate anomalies with breakout dynamics, creating a systematic approach to capture short squeezes while maintaining strict volatility controls.
