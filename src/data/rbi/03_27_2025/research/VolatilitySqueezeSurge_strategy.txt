STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction (<1%)**: Identifies periods of low volatility, often preceding significant price movements.  
2. **RSI Crossover (>35)**: Confirms emerging bullish momentum after oversold conditions.  
3. **Volume Surge (>15%)**: Validates increased participation in the breakout.  
4. **ATR-Based Target (1.5x)**: Uses Average True Range for dynamic profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when:  
  - Bollinger Band width (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band < 1% (volatility squeeze).  
  - RSI crosses above 35 (momentum shift from oversold).  
  - Volume exceeds 15% of its 20-period average (surge confirmation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target**: 1.5x the current ATR (14-period) from entry price.  
- **Stop Loss**: None explicitly defined; consider adding a trailing stop (e.g., 0.5x ATR) or fixed % risk (e.g., 2%).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Allocate 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Stop Loss Suggestion**: Add a stop at 0.5x ATR or recent swing low to limit downside.  
- **Filter**: Avoid trades during major news events or illiquid sessions.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – For width calculation.  
2. **RSI (14-period)** – Momentum confirmation.  
3. **Volume (20-period average)** – Surge detection.  
4. **ATR (14-period)** – Dynamic exit scaling.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction, momentum reversal, and volume confirmation for high-probability breakouts. Works best in ranging or consolidating markets.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test RSI thresholds (e.g., 30-40) for different assets.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.2x-2x) based on asset volatility.  
- Add a time filter (e.g., only trade first 2 hours of session).  

**Note:** Backtest for asset-specific tuning—cryptocurrencies may require wider ATR targets vs. forex.
