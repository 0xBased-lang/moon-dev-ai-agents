STRATEGY_NAME: KeltnerDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the Keltner Channel and RSI indicators to identify high-probability reversal opportunities through divergence patterns, with precise entry/exit rules based on channel breaks and volatility-adjusted targets.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA with 1.5x ATR bands)
2. RSI (14-period)
3. ATR (14-period for exit calculation)

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Price must close BELOW lower Keltner Channel band
2. RSI must show bullish divergence (higher low while price makes lower low)
3. RSI must be below 40 (showing oversold condition)
4. Enter at next candle's open

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Price must close ABOVE upper Keltner Channel band
2. RSI must show bearish divergence (lower high while price makes higher high)
3. RSI must be above 60 (showing overbought condition)
4. Enter at next candle's open

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 2x current 14-period ATR from entry price
2. Stop Loss: 1x current 14-period ATR from entry price
3. Time Exit: Close position after 5 candles if not hit target/stop

Risk Management:
1. Fixed 1% risk per trade (adjust position size accordingly)
2. Maximum 3 open positions at any time
3. No trading during major news events
4. Daily loss limit of 3% (stop trading if hit)

Indicator Settings:
- Keltner Channel: 20 EMA, 1.5 ATR multiplier
- RSI: 14 periods
- ATR: 14 periods (for both channel and exits)

Unique Aspects:
1. Combines volatility expansion (channel break) with momentum confirmation (RSI divergence)
2. Uses adaptive profit targets based on current market volatility
3. Requires both price action and momentum confirmation for entries
4. Strict risk controls with multiple safeguards

Optimization Notes:
1. Test ATR multipliers (1.3-2.0) for channel width
2. Experiment with RSI period (10-20) and threshold levels
3. Consider adjusting profit target ratio (1.5-3x ATR)
4. May add volume filter for stronger confirmation

This strategy works best in ranging markets and can capture strong reversals after volatile price movements, while the ATR-based exits ensure risk is always proportional to current market conditions.
