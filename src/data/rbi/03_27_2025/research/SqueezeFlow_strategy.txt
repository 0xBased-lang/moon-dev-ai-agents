STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeFlow  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection:**  
   - Uses a 20-day Bollinger Band bandwidth (Upper Band - Lower Band)  
   - Identifies a squeeze when the current bandwidth is below 50% of its 100-day median  
   - Indicates low volatility and potential breakout conditions  

2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) Confirmation:**  
   - 20-day CMF is used to confirm money flow strength  
   - Long entry triggered when CMF crosses above zero during a squeeze  
   - Exit on CMF reversal below zero or price breaching 1.5x the upper Bollinger Band  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Band (20,2) bandwidth is < 50% of its 100-day median (squeeze confirmed)  
- **Condition 2:** 20-day CMF crosses above zero (bullish money flow)  
- **Action:** Enter long at market price  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Condition 1:** 20-day CMF crosses below zero (bearish money flow reversal)  
- **Exit Condition 2:** Price breaches 1.5x the upper Bollinger Band (profit-taking or volatility expansion)  
- **Action:** Close position at market price  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss: Optional trailing stop based on recent swing low or fixed % risk per trade  
- Position sizing: Adjust based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing)  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) – for squeeze detection and volatility bands  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20) – for money flow confirmation  
3. Bandwidth calculation: (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band  
4. 100-day median of bandwidth for squeeze threshold  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or consolidating markets  
- Avoid trading during strong trending phases (use ADX filter if needed)  
- Backtest optimal CMF period (20-day default) for specific instruments  

This strategy combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with money flow confirmation for high-probability breakout trades. The 1.5x upper band exit locks in profits during strong expansions.
