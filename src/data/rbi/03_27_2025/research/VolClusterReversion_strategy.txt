STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility analysis with liquidity targeting to identify potential reversal points in trending markets. The core concept revolves around using Average True Range (ATR) to measure volatility and identify extreme price movements that may indicate exhaustion in the current trend.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses ATR (14-period recommended) to quantify market volatility
2. Liquidity Targeting: Focuses on price extremes (20-day high/10-day low) where stop orders may cluster
3. Mean Reversion Logic: Assumes extreme moves beyond normal volatility ranges may reverse

Entry Rules:
- Go LONG when price reaches 2x ATR below the 20-day high
- This suggests an oversold condition where price has moved significantly beyond normal volatility ranges
- The 20-day high acts as a reference point for recent price extremes

Exit Rules:
- Close position when price reaches 1x ATR above the 10-day low
- This provides a logical profit-taking level based on recent support areas
- The 10-day low serves as a short-term reference for support

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Should be based on ATR (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade)
2. Stop Loss: Recommended at 2x ATR below entry point
3. Volatility Filter: Avoid trading when ATR is below its 20-period moving average (low volatility periods)

Required Indicators:
1. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period recommended
2. 20-day High (rolling calculation)
3. 10-day Low (rolling calculation)

Additional Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets with periodic pullbacks
- May generate false signals in ranging markets
- Performance improves with additional confirmation (e.g., RSI divergence, volume spikes)
- Timeframe agnostic but performs best on 4H or daily charts

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on asset volatility (1.5-3x range)
- Experiment with different lookback periods for highs/lows
- Consider adding a trend filter (e.g., only trade long when price above 200MA)

This strategy capitalizes on the tendency for extreme volatility moves to revert, particularly when targeting areas where stop orders may cluster (liquidation zones). The unique combination of volatility measurement and liquidity targeting makes it particularly effective in volatile trending markets.
