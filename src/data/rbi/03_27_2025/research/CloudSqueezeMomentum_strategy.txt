STRATEGY_NAME: CloudSqueezeMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the trend-confirming power of Ichimoku Cloud analysis with momentum confirmation from the TTM Squeeze indicator, using Heikin-Ashi candles for smoother trend visualization.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candles (4H timeframe) - Provides cleaner trend visualization by filtering market noise
2. Ichimoku Cloud - Determines overall trend direction and support/resistance levels
3. TTM Squeeze - Identifies momentum shifts and volatility contractions

Entry Rules (Long Only):
1. Primary Condition: 4H Heikin-Ashi candle must close ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud
2. Confirmation: TTM Squeeze histogram must turn positive (transition from negative/zero to positive)
3. Volume confirmation (recommended): Increasing volume on breakout candle strengthens signal

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price closes back INSIDE or BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud
2. Secondary Exit: When TTM Squeeze histogram contracts (loses momentum) after being positive
3. Emergency Exit: If price makes a lower low while above cloud (potential false breakout)

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop below most recent swing low OR below Cloud base
3. Trailing Stop: Consider moving stop to breakeven when price reaches 1.5x risk
4. Maximum Drawdown: Cease trading if account loses 5% in a week

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candles (replace standard candles)
2. Ichimoku Cloud (standard settings: 9/26/52)
3. TTM Squeeze (default settings typically work well)

Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets, may produce false signals during ranging periods
- Combine with higher timeframe (daily) Cloud analysis for stronger confirmation
- Avoid trading during major news events that may cause volatility spikes
- Ideal for forex and commodity markets with strong trending characteristics
