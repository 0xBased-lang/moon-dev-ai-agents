STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityVolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines order book liquidity analysis with short-term volatility spikes to identify high-probability breakout trades. The unique approach focuses on areas of concentrated liquidation levels (where many stop losses cluster) and waits for volatility confirmation before entering.

Key Components:
1. Liquidity Heatmap Analysis: Identifies high liquidation clusters in the order book where price is likely to accelerate through
2. Volatility Spike Detection: Uses 1-minute volatility readings to confirm breakout momentum
3. Breakout Confirmation: Requires price to breach key liquidity levels with increased volume

Entry Rules:
1. Identify proximity (within 1-2%) to a major liquidation cluster on the heatmap
2. Wait for volatility to spike 2-3x above the 15-minute average
3. Enter long when price breaks above the cluster high with increased volume
4. Enter short when price breaks below the cluster low with increased volume

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit at next significant liquidity level (1.5-2x risk)
2. Stop loss placed just beyond the opposite side of the liquidity cluster
3. Exit if volatility drops below entry level for 3 consecutive minutes

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss always placed before entry
3. No trading during major news events when liquidity is unreliable
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%

Required Indicators:
1. Order book liquidity heatmap (showing liquidation clusters)
2. 1-minute volatility indicator (ATR or standard deviation)
3. Volume spike detector
4. Key support/resistance levels marked on heatmap

Additional Notes:
- Works best on liquid assets with deep order books (major crypto pairs, forex majors)
- Most effective during active trading hours (London/NY overlap)
- Requires constant monitoring of order book dynamics
- Backtest with attention to false breakouts near liquidity zones
