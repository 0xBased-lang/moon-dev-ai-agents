STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of extreme low volatility when the Bollinger Band Width (BBW) contracts below its 6-month low, signaling a potential breakout setup.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a surge in trading volume exceeding the 20-day average, ensuring strong participation in the move.  
3. **Average True Range (ATR) Stop:** Risk is managed using a dynamic stop-loss set at 1.5x the ATR of the squeeze period, adjusting for recent volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  1. BBW contracts below its 6-month low (indicating a squeeze).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume exceeds the 20-day average volume by a significant margin (e.g., 20-50% higher).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Trail the stop or use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1) based on the initial ATR stop distance.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place the stop at 1.5x the ATR of the squeeze period (typically 10-20 days).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be based on the ATR stop distance to ensure risk per trade is limited (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) + BBW (Bollinger Band Width).  
2. 20-day moving average of volume.  
3. Average True Range (ATR, typically 14-period) for stop calculation.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction (squeeze) with volume confirmation (surge) for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses ATR for adaptive stop placement, aligning risk with recent market conditions.  
- Focuses on rare but high-conviction setups (6-month BBW lows).  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize BBW lookback period (6 months) and volume surge threshold for specific instruments.
