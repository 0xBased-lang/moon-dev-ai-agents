STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaBand Expansion  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands Width Percentile (BBWP):** Measures volatility contraction by calculating the percentile rank of the current Bollinger Bands width relative to historical values (typically 20-50 periods). Low percentiles (<20%) indicate extreme contraction, signaling potential expansion opportunities.  
2. **MACD Crossover Confirmation:** Uses the MACD (12,26,9) to validate entriesâ€”only trades in the direction of the MACD line crossing above/below the signal line.  
3. **Bollinger Bands Touch Exit:** Exits positions when price touches the opposite band (e.g., exit long at upper band, exit short at lower band).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. BBWP < 20% (volatility contraction).  
  2. MACD line crosses above signal line (bullish confirmation).  
  3. Enter on first candle closing outside the Bollinger Bands after contraction.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. BBWP < 20%.  
  2. MACD line crosses below signal line (bearish confirmation).  
  3. Enter on first candle closing outside the bands.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Close position when price touches the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Short Exit:** Close position when price touches the lower Bollinger Band.  
- **Optional Stop-Loss:** Set at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the contraction period to limit risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  
- Filter trades using higher timeframes (e.g., only trade longs if daily trend is up).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 Std Dev).  
2. Bollinger Bands Width Percentile (custom calculation).  
3. MACD (12, 26, 9).  
4. Optional: ATR (14) for stop-loss.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility quantiles with momentum confirmation, targeting high-probability expansions after low-volatility regimes. The opposing-band exit locks in profits before mean reversion occurs.  

**Note:** Backtest optimal BBWP thresholds (e.g., 10-30%) and band settings for specific assets, as volatility characteristics vary.
