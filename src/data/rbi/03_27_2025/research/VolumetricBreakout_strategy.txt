STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility expansion with volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The key components are:

1. INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
- Volume (20-day simple moving average)
- RSI (14-period)

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Price must close ABOVE the upper Bollinger Band
- Current volume must be at least 2x the 20-day average volume
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously on the same candle

3. EXIT RULES:
- When RSI(14) crosses BELOW 70 from above
- Or when price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands (optional additional exit)

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Initial stop-loss should be placed at the middle Bollinger Band (20-SMA)
- Position size should account for the volatility (wider bands = smaller position)
- Consider implementing a time-based exit (e.g., close after 5 days if not exited)

5. KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Targets strong momentum moves with volume confirmation
- Works best in trending markets with expanding volatility
- Avoids false breakouts through volume filter
- Uses RSI to capture the bulk of the momentum move while avoiding overbought reversals

6. OPTIMIZATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- Test different volume multipliers (1.5x-3x)
- Experiment with RSI exit thresholds (65-75)
- Consider adding a minimum price movement filter (e.g., breakout must be >1% above band)

This strategy is particularly effective during earnings seasons or other high-impact news events when volatility and volume spikes are more likely to sustain directional moves.
