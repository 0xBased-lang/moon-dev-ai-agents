STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiSqueeze Volatility  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Focus:** Targets periods of reduced volatility (Bollinger Band narrowing) near high-liquidation zones, anticipating explosive moves.  
2. **Liquidation Cluster Analysis:** Identifies price levels with dense stop-loss orders (liquidation zones) where forced exits may trigger cascading price movements.  
3. **Bollinger Band Dynamics:** Uses band width contraction as a precursor to volatility expansion, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup:**  
   - Price approaches a pre-identified liquidation cluster (e.g., high-volume node, order block, or historical liquidity pool).  
   - Bollinger Band width (BBW) narrows to a threshold (e.g., lowest 20% of recent readings), indicating compression.  
2. **Trigger:**  
   - Short entry when price tests the liquidation cluster *and* shows rejection (e.g., pin bar, bearish engulfing) against the zone.  
   - Confirm with RSI (14-period) > 60 (overbought bias) to align with mean-reversion logic.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit-Taking:**  
   - Partial exit on Bollinger Band expansion (BBW increases by X% from entry).  
   - Full exit if price sweeps liquidity below the cluster (e.g., wicks into prior lows) and shows reversal signs (e.g., bullish divergence).  
2. **Stop-Loss:**  
   - Place above the recent swing high or the upper Bollinger Band, whichever is tighter.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size capped at 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Require a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false volatility spikes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To identify contraction/expansion phases.  
2. **RSI (14)** – For overbought/oversold confirmation.  
3. **Volume Profile/Liquidation Heatmap** – To pinpoint high-liquidation zones (external tools like Bookmap or TradingView scripts).  

**Unique Edge:**  
Combines liquidity hunting behavior with volatility cycles, exploiting the "squeeze" before liquidity-driven breakouts. The name "LiquiSqueeze Volatility" reflects this dual focus on liquidation zones and Bollinger Band compression.
