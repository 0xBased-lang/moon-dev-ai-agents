STRATEGY_NAME: AnchoredBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands Anchored to VWAP:** This strategy uses Bollinger Bands calculated from the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) instead of a simple moving average. This provides a more dynamic and volume-adjusted measure of volatility.  
2. **ADX Filter:** The strategy only trades during high ADX (Average Directional Index) regimes (typically ADX > 25), indicating strong trending conditions.  
3. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a surge in trading volume exceeding the 90th percentile of recent volume history, ensuring strong participation in the move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Long Entry:**  
   - Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band anchored to VWAP.  
   - ADX is above 25 (confirming a strong trend).  
   - Volume on the breakout candle exceeds the 90th percentile of volume over the past 20-50 periods.  

2. **Short Entry:**  
   - Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band anchored to VWAP.  
   - ADX is above 25.  
   - Volume on the breakout candle exceeds the 90th percentile of volume over the past 20-50 periods.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:**  
   - Use a trailing stop based on the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g., for a long trade, exit when price closes back inside the upper band).  
   - Alternatively, target a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).  

2. **Stop Loss:**  
   - Place a stop loss just below the breakout candle's low (for long trades) or above its high (for short trades).  
   - Alternatively, use the middle line of the Bollinger Bands (VWAP) as a dynamic stop level.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Volatility Adjustment:** Wider Bollinger Bands (higher volatility) may require smaller position sizes to maintain consistent risk.  
3. **Avoid Low ADX:** Do not trade if ADX is below 25, as breakouts are less reliable in non-trending markets.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (Anchored to VWAP):**  
   - Period: Typically 20-50 periods.  
   - Standard Deviation: Usually 2.  
2. **VWAP:** Volume-Weighted Average Price for anchoring the Bollinger Bands.  
3. **ADX (Average Directional Index):** 14-period ADX with a threshold of 25 for trend strength.  
4. **Volume Surge Filter:** 90th percentile of volume over a lookback period (e.g., 20-50 bars).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility (Bollinger Bands), volume (VWAP and surge), and trend strength (ADX) for high-probability breakouts.  
- Anchoring Bollinger Bands to VWAP makes the bands more responsive to volume-based price action.  
- Volume surge requirement filters out false breakouts.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different Bollinger Band periods (e.g., 20 vs. 50) and standard deviations (e.g., 1.5 vs. 2).  
- Adjust the ADX threshold (e.g., 20 for less strict trends or 30 for stronger trends).  
- Fine-tune the volume percentile (e.g., 85th or 95th) based on the asset's liquidity.  

This strategy is best suited for trending markets and liquid assets where volume surges are meaningful. Avoid using it in choppy or range-bound conditions.
