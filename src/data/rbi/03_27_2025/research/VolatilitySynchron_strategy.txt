STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySynchron  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Composite Indicator:** Combines three distinct volatility metrics:  
   - **Normalized Keltner Channel Squeeze:** Measures contraction/expansion of volatility bands (typically using ATR-based Keltner Channels).  
   - **3-Day Volume Entropy:** Quantifies disorder in recent volume patterns (higher entropy suggests volatility potential).  
   - **Overnight Gap Percentage:** Tracks price gaps between sessions as a volatility signal.  
2. **Regime Filter:** Only trades when all three metrics exceed their rolling percentile thresholds (e.g., 80th percentile), ensuring alignment across volatility dimensions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  1. Keltner squeeze exits contraction (normalized value crosses above threshold).  
  2. Volume entropy spikes above its percentile threshold (e.g., >80%).  
  3. Overnight gap exceeds its percentile threshold (e.g., >75%).  
- **Short Entry:** Same logic but for downside volatility (e.g., gap down + entropy spike).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking:** Close trade when:  
  1. Keltner bands expand to 1.5x the entry width (volatility exhaustion).  
  2. Volume entropy drops below median (50th percentile).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Dynamic trailing stop at 2x the recent ATR (14-period).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk â‰¤1% per trade based on stop distance.  
- No trades during scheduled high-impact news events (reduce noise).  
- Maximum 3 concurrent open trades to avoid overexposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width).  
2. Volume Entropy (3-day Shannon entropy calculation).  
3. Overnight Gap Percentage: \( \frac{|Open - Prior Close|}{Prior Close} \).  
4. Rolling Percentiles (lookback 50-100 periods for thresholds).  

**Unique Edge:**  
- **Synchronicity Focus:** Requires *all three* volatility dimensions to align, reducing false signals.  
- **Normalization:** Metrics are scaled to percentile ranges for adaptive regime detection.  
- **Overnight Gap Integration:** Captures institutional flow shifts missed by intraday indicators.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test percentile thresholds (70-90%) for each component.  
- Adjust ATR multiplier for Keltner expansion exit (1.3x-2x).  
- Backtest across asset classes (works best on equities/indices with overnight sessions).
