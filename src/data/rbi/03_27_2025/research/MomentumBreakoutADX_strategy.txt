STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBreakoutADX

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation, momentum strength, and volatility-based risk management to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. KEY COMPONENTS:
- Trend Identification: Uses the 50/200 EMA crossover as the primary trend filter
- Momentum Confirmation: Requires ADX > 25 to validate trend strength
- Volatility Adjustment: Uses ATR for dynamic position sizing and stop placement
- Reward Optimization: Targets 3:1 profit ratio while limiting downside

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Primary Condition: 50-period EMA must cross ABOVE 200-period EMA
- Secondary Condition: ADX must be rising and > 25 (indicating strong trend)
- Entry Trigger: Price breaks above nearest swing high (for long positions)
- Confirmation: Volume should ideally increase on the breakout

3. EXIT RULES:
- Stop Loss: 2x ATR below entry price (adjusted daily)
- Take Profit: 3x the risk amount (6x ATR above entry)
- Emergency Exit: If ADX falls below 20 (trend weakening)
- Time Exit: Close position if target not hit within 5 bars

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum Drawdown: 5% of account per week
- Trade Filter: Only trade when ATR > 1.5x 20-period average (volatility expansion)
- Correlation Limit: No more than 3 similar positions open simultaneously

5. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period EMA
- ADX (14-period) with +DI/-DI lines
- ATR (14-period)
- Volume indicator (optional but recommended)

6. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Test different EMA periods (e.g., 30/100) for various timeframes
- Adjust ADX threshold based on asset volatility (25-30 range)
- Consider using closing prices vs. intraday highs for breakouts
- Backtest different ATR multiples (1.5-2.5x) for stop placement

This strategy works best in trending markets on daily or 4-hour timeframes, and requires patience to wait for all conditions to align properly. The combination of trend confirmation, momentum measurement, and volatility-adjusted stops creates a systematic approach to breakout trading.
