STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Breakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Compression Detection:** Uses Bollinger Band width to identify periods of low volatility (compression) when the width reaches a 20-day low.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires price to break above the upper Bollinger Band (for long) or below the lower Bollinger Band (for short) with volume confirmation.  
3. **Volume Spike Filter:** Entry is only valid if volume exceeds the 50-day average volume, ensuring momentum supports the breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Bollinger Band width (BB Width) reaches a 20-day low (indicating compression).  
  2. Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume on breakout candle exceeds the 50-day average volume.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. BB Width reaches a 20-day low.  
  2. Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  3. Volume on breakout candle exceeds the 50-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  1. Price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands (below the upper band).  
  2. Or, if trailing stop is used: Exit when price retraces a fixed percentage (e.g., 2%) from the recent high after entry.  
- **Short Exit:**  
  1. Price closes back inside the Bollinger Bands (above the lower band).  
  2. Or, trailing stop: Exit when price rallies a fixed percentage (e.g., 2%) from the recent low after entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Stop-loss placed at the opposite Bollinger Band (for long: lower band; for short: upper band) or a fixed ATR-based distance.  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. Bollinger Band Width (BB Width = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  
3. 50-day average volume (simple moving average of volume).  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- False breakouts are mitigated by the volume filter.  
- Adjust parameters (e.g., BB period, ATR multiplier for stops) based on asset volatility.  

This strategy capitalizes on the "squeeze" effect, where low volatility often precedes high-momentum moves, while volume confirms genuine breakout strength.
