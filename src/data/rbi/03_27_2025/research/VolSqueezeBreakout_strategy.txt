STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Donchian Channel Breakout:** Uses a 20-period Donchian Channel (high/low range) to identify potential breakout levels.  
2. **Volatility Filter:** Requires the Donchian Channel width to be below a historical volatility percentile (e.g., 30th percentile), indicating a "volatility squeeze."  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Breakout trades are only taken if volume surges above its 50-day median, confirming participation.  
4. **Exit Conditions:** Exits occur on either a reversal of the Donchian Channel (price closing back inside) or a sharp volatility spike (e.g., channel width expanding beyond a threshold).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Price closes above the upper Donchian Channel band while:  
  - Channel width is below its historical volatility percentile (e.g., 30th percentile).  
  - Volume exceeds its 50-day median.  
- **Short Entry:** Price closes below the lower Donchian Channel band while the same volatility and volume conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop placed at the opposite Donchian band (e.g., long stop at lower band).  
- **Volatility Spike Exit:** Exit if the Donchian Channel width expands beyond a dynamic threshold (e.g., 70th percentile of recent width values).  
- **Reversal Exit:** Exit if price closes back inside the Donchian Channel.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on the Donchian Channel width (e.g., risk 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during major economic events that may cause false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 20-period Donchian Channel (high/low).  
2. Historical volatility percentile (e.g., 30-day rolling percentile of channel width).  
3. 50-day median volume.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility contraction ("squeeze") with volume confirmation for higher-probability breakouts.  
- Dynamic exits adapt to both price action (channel reversal) and volatility regime changes.  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize volatility percentile thresholds and volume filters for your asset class.
