STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeExtension

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band squeezes with Chaikin Oscillator confirmation and Fibonacci extension targets for precise volatility-based entries and profit-taking.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) to identify volatility contractions
2. Chaikin Oscillator (3,10 periods) for volume-flow confirmation
3. Fibonacci extensions (127%, 161.8%) derived from recent volatility range

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below 30% of its 20-period average (squeeze condition)
2. Chaikin Oscillator must cross above zero line confirming accumulation
3. Enter long when price breaks and closes above upper Bollinger Band
4. Entry only valid if all conditions occur within 3 bars of each other

Exit Rules:
1. Primary target: 127% Fibonacci extension of recent squeeze range (high-low during squeeze period)
2. Secondary target: 161.8% extension (trail stop after hitting 127%)
3. Emergency stop: Close below lower Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Initial stop placed at recent swing low or lower band (whichever is closer)
3. Volatility-adjusted position sizing (reduce size during high ATR periods)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Chaikin Oscillator (3,10)
3. Fibonacci extension tool
4. Bandwidth indicator (optional but helpful for squeeze detection)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best applied to 1H-4H timeframes for reliable signals
2. Works particularly well in ranging markets transitioning to trends
3. Combine with sector/overall market confirmation for higher probability trades
4. Filter for ADX > 25 to confirm emerging trend strength

This strategy captures the explosive moves following volatility contractions while using volume confirmation to filter false breakouts and Fibonacci extensions to lock in profits at logical levels.
