STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurge Bandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility-adjusted VWAP bands with volume surges to identify high-probability breakout opportunities, while using VWAP reversion as the exit signal.

Key Components:
1. Volatility-Adjusted VWAP Bands: Standard VWAP with upper/lower bands adjusted by recent volatility (ATR or standard deviation)
2. Volume Surge Filter: Requires trading volume to exceed a multiple (e.g., 1.5-2x) of recent average volume
3. Mean Reversion Exit: Returns to VWAP serve as profit-taking signals

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- Price closes ABOVE upper VWAP volatility band
- Current volume > (1.5x 20-period volume average)
- Confirmation: Next candle opens in same direction

SHORT ENTRY:
- Price closes BELOW lower VWAP volatility band
- Current volume > (1.5x 20-period volume average)
- Confirmation: Next candle opens in same direction

Exit Rules:
LONG EXIT:
- Price crosses back below VWAP line
- OR reaches 2:1 profit target based on band width

SHORT EXIT:
- Price crosses back above VWAP line
- OR reaches 2:1 profit target based on band width

Risk Management:
1. Stop Loss: 
   - Longs: Below recent swing low or lower band
   - Shorts: Above recent swing high or upper band
2. Position Sizing: Risk ≤1-2% per trade
3. Time Filter: Avoid first/last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
2. Volatility Bands (VWAP ± 2*ATR or 1.5 StdDev)
3. Volume Indicator (20-period MA)
4. Optional: Confirmation oscillator (RSI or MACD)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust band multiplier based on asset volatility
- Fine-tune volume surge threshold (1.5-3x avg)
- Test different confirmation periods (1-3 candles)

This strategy works best in trending markets with clear volatility expansions, and benefits from combining the reliability of VWAP with the momentum confirmation of volume surges.
