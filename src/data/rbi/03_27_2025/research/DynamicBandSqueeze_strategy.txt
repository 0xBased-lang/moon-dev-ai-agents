STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicBandSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines trend strength analysis with volatility contraction to identify high-probability breakout opportunities, while using dynamic channel-based exits for risk management.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **ADX (Average Directional Index)** - Measures trend strength (threshold: >25 for strong trend)  
2. **Bollinger Bands** - Identifies volatility contraction (bandwidth narrowing)  
3. **Keltner Channel** - Provides dynamic exit levels (middle line as trailing stop)  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for ADX >25 (confirming strong trend environment)  
2. Identify Bollinger Band contraction (bands within 2% of each other for 3 consecutive periods)  
3. Enter long on close above upper Bollinger Band  
4. Enter short on close below lower Bollinger Band  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. For long positions: Exit when price closes below Keltner Channel midline  
2. For short positions: Exit when price closes above Keltner Channel midline  
3. Alternative exit: 2:1 reward-risk ratio take-profit  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position size: 1-2% risk per trade  
2. Initial stop-loss:  
   - Longs: Recent swing low or lower Bollinger Band  
   - Shorts: Recent swing high or upper Bollinger Band  
3. Trailing stop: Keltner Channel midline acts as dynamic stop  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. ADX (14-period)  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)  
3. Keltner Channel (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (ADX) with volatility signals (Bollinger contraction)  
- Uses Keltner Channel's mean-reversion tendency for exits rather than entries  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation periods  
- Timeframe: 1H or 4H charts for optimal results  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Adjust ADX threshold (20-30 range) based on market volatility  
- Test different Bollinger Band periods (14-22) for your instrument  
- Keltner Channel multiplier can range from 1-2 ATR depending on aggressiveness
