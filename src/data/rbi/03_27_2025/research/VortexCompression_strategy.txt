STRATEGY_NAME: VortexCompression  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Tracks directional movement via VI+ (bullish) and VI- (bearish) lines.  
2. **Volume Surge:** Requires above-average volume to confirm breakout validity.  
3. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies low volatility periods before potential breakouts.  

**Entry Rules (Long):**  
- **VI+ Crossover:** VI+ must cross above VI-, signaling bullish momentum.  
- **Volume Confirmation:** Current volume must exceed its 20-period moving average.  
- **Volatility Compression:** Bollinger Band width (BBW) must be below its 10-period average, indicating contraction.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Close position when price touches the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Stop Loss:** Set at the lower Bollinger Band or recent swing low (whichever is closer).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Stop-loss must be placed immediately after entry.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-)  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev)  
3. Volume (20-period MA for surge detection)  
4. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) for volatility measurement  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend confirmation (VI), volume-fueled momentum, and volatility cycles for high-probability entries during "coiled" market conditions.
