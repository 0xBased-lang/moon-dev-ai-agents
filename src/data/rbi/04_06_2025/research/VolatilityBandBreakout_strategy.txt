STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBandBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility measurement with Bollinger Band dynamics to identify high-probability breakout opportunities in 5-minute timeframes. The core concept revolves around detecting when market volatility expands beyond normal ranges, signaling potential strong directional moves.

Key Components:
1. ATR (14-period) - Measures true volatility range
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) - Defines normal price range
3. Bollinger Band Width - Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band
4. Trailing Stop Mechanism - Dynamic exit based on current volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for 5-minute ATR(14) value to cross ABOVE the Bollinger Band Width
2. Enter long if price breaks above current candle's high (for bullish breakout)
3. Enter short if price breaks below current candle's low (for bearish breakout)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: 2:1 Risk-Reward Ratio
   - Calculate entry-to-stop distance (1.5x current ATR)
   - Set profit target at twice this distance from entry
2. Secondary Exit: Trailing Stop
   - Initial stop: 1.5x ATR from entry price
   - Trail stop by 0.5x ATR as price moves favorably
3. Emergency Exit: Close position if ATR drops below Bollinger Band Width again

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1.5x ATR stop distance
2. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of account
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (cool-down period)

Required Indicators:
1. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period
2. Bollinger Bands - 20 period, 2 standard deviations
3. Bollinger Band Width indicator

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for high-volume, high-volatility instruments
2. Most effective during active market hours (avoid overnight gaps)
3. Works well in trending markets, may produce false signals in ranging conditions

The VolatilityBandBreakout strategy uniquely combines two volatility measures (ATR and BB Width) to filter only the most significant breakouts, while the dynamic trailing stop adapts to changing market conditions. The 2:1 reward ratio ensures positive expectancy over time.
