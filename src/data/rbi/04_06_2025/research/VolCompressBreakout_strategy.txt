STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Breakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by potential breakouts, using Bollinger Bands and volume confirmation for precise entries and exits.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width:** Measures volatility compression (20-day low width signals potential breakout).  
2. **Volume Spike:** Confirms breakout validity (must exceed 50-day average volume).  
3. **Bollinger Band Cross:** Defines exit points (upper/lower band cross).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger when Bollinger Band width (BBW) reaches a 20-day low.  
- Confirm entry with volume exceeding the 50-day average volume.  
- Enter long if price breaks above the middle band (SMA 20) with volume confirmation.  
- Enter short if price breaks below the middle band with volume confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit/Stop Loss:** Exit when price crosses the opposite Bollinger Band (upper band for longs, lower band for shorts).  
- **Emergency Exit:** Close position if volume drops below 50-day average for 2 consecutive bars.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size: 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  
- Filter trades using a higher timeframe trend (e.g., only trade longs if weekly trend is up).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) – for width calculation and band cross.  
2. Volume MA (50-day) – to confirm breakout strength.  
3. Optional: SMA 200 (higher timeframe trend filter).  

**Unique Edge:**  
Combines volatility compression (BBW) with volume-fueled breakouts, reducing false signals common in pure Bollinger strategies.
