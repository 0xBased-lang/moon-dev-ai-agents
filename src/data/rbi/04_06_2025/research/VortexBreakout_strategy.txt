STRATEGY_NAME: VortexBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the directional confirmation of the Vortex Indicator with the volatility-based boundaries of Keltner Channels to identify high-probability breakout trades with built-in trend confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) - Comprised of VI+ (bullish trend) and VI- (bearish trend) lines
2. Keltner Channels - A volatility-based envelope with upper, middle, and lower bands
3. Trailing stop mechanism based on channel width

Entry Rules:
Long Entry:
- VI+ line crosses above VI- line (bullish confirmation)
- Price closes above the upper Keltner Band (breakout signal)
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Short Entry:
- VI- line crosses above VI+ line (bearish confirmation)
- Price closes below the lower Keltner Band (breakout signal)
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
- Trailing stop based on Keltner Channel width:
  * For long positions: Exit when price closes below (Upper Band - X% of Channel Width)
  * For short positions: Exit when price closes above (Lower Band + X% of Channel Width)
- Recommended X% value between 25-50% based on volatility

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk tolerance (1-2% per trade recommended)
2. Initial stop can be placed at the opposite band (middle band for aggressive, opposite band for conservative)
3. Trailing stop locks in profits as trend develops
4. Avoid trading during low volatility when channels contract significantly

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (standard 14-period setting recommended)
2. Keltner Channels (typical settings: 20-period EMA, 2.5x ATR(10) width)
3. Optional: Volume indicator to confirm breakout strength

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- More reliable in trending markets than ranging conditions
- Combine with fundamental/seasonal trends for higher probability setups
- Recommended to filter with higher timeframe trend alignment
