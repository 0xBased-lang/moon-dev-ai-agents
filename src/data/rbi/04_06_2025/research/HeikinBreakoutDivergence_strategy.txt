STRATEGY_NAME: HeikinBreakoutDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Heikin-Ashi candlestick patterns with Bollinger Band breakouts and TICK divergence confirmation for high-probability momentum trades. The unique combination of smoothed price action (Heikin-Ashi), volatility bands (Bollinger), and market breadth (TICK) creates a robust breakout system with built-in momentum confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candles (15-min timeframe)
2. Bollinger Bands (2.5 standard deviations)
3. TICK Index divergence analysis
4. Fractal-based stop placement

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Heikin-Ashi candle to CLOSE outside Bollinger Bands (2.5σ)
2. Confirm with TICK divergence:
   - For long entry: Higher price low with higher TICK low
   - For short entry: Lower price high with lower TICK high
3. Enter on next candle open

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking:
   - Close position when price returns inside Bollinger Bands
   - Or when opposite TICK divergence appears
2. Stop-loss:
   - Longs: Prior fractal low
   - Shorts: Prior fractal high
   - Maximum risk: 1-2% of account per trade

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on distance to fractal stop
2. Never risk more than 2% of account on single trade
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Reduce size during low volatility periods

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (converted from regular price)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2.5σ)
3. TICK Index (NYSE or equivalent)
4. Fractal indicator (for stop placement)

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different Bollinger Band deviations (2.0-3.0σ)
2. Experiment with various timeframes (10-30 min)
3. Consider adding volume filter for confirmation
4. Backtest across different market conditions

This strategy excels in trending markets but may produce false signals during choppy conditions. The combination of Heikin-Ashi smoothing and TICK divergence helps filter out many false breakouts while the fractal-based stops provide logical risk points.
