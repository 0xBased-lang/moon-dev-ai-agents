STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the Vortex Indicator's trend detection with volume confirmation and volatility-based exits for high-probability trades.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-) - Identifies trend direction and strength
2. Volume Filter - Confirms entries with significant volume surge
3. ATR Trailing Stop - Manages exits based on market volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VI+ (positive trend indicator) crosses above VI- (negative trend indicator)
2. Confirmation: Current volume must exceed 1.5x the 20-day average volume
3. Ideal Context: Best used in trending markets, avoid during choppy/rangebound conditions

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: VI- crosses back above VI+ (trend reversal signal)
2. Protective Stop: 3x ATR trailing stop (adjusts with volatility)
3. Optional Profit Target: Consider 2:1 risk-reward ratio based on entry-to-stop distance

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop at 3x ATR from entry point
3. Trade Filter: Only take trades with clear trend direction (VI+ > VI- by significant margin)

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines)
   - Typical period setting: 14 (default)
2. Volume (with 20-day moving average)
3. Average True Range (ATR)
   - Recommended period: 14

Optimization Tips:
1. Test different volume multipliers (1.3x-2x) for your market
2. Adjust ATR multiplier (2.5x-3.5x) based on volatility tolerance
3. Consider adding a trend filter (e.g., price above 200MA for longs)

Special Notes:
- Works best on daily charts for swing trading
- More reliable in liquid markets with clear trends
- Combine with price action confirmation for higher accuracy
- Avoid using during major news events when volume spikes may be misleading
