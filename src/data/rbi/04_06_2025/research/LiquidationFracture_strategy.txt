STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFracture

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on detecting and capitalizing on liquidation cascades in futures markets
- Combines on-chain liquidation data with technical analysis
- Uses a 7-day baseline for liquidation activity comparison
- Incorporates Ichimoku Cloud for trend confirmation
- Employs ATR for dynamic exit positioning

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Trigger: Aggregated long liquidations spike to 3x the 7-day average
- Technical Confirmation: Price must break below the Ichimoku Cloud
- Entry Execution: Short position initiated upon both conditions being met
- Ideal Conditions: High leverage markets during periods of elevated open interest

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit Target: 1.5x the current ATR (14-period) from entry point
- Emergency Exit: If liquidation spike reverses below 2x 7-day average
- Time Consideration: Consider closing position if no follow-through within 4 hours

4. Risk Management:
- Position Sizing: Maximum 2% of capital per trade
- Stop Loss: 2x ATR above entry point (or above recent swing high if tighter)
- Market Filter: Avoid trading during scheduled high-impact news events
- Liquidity Check: Verify adequate order book depth before entering

5. Required Indicators:
- On-chain liquidation data feed (aggregated across major exchanges)
- Ichimoku Cloud (standard 9-26-52 settings)
- ATR (14-period)
- 7-day moving average of liquidation volumes

6. Additional Considerations:
- Works best in altcoin futures with high leverage availability
- Requires real-time monitoring of liquidation data
- Most effective during trending market conditions
- Should be avoided in low-liquidity markets
- Backtest across multiple liquidation events for optimal parameters

Implementation Notes:
- Requires API access to reliable liquidation data sources
- Cloud break should be confirmed on 1H or 4H timeframe for significance
- Consider adding volume confirmation for extra validation
- Monitor funding rates as secondary confirmation signal
