STRATEGY_NAME: VolDeltaBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Volatility-adjusted VWAP envelope (VWAP Â± 2x ATR) forms the core trading range
- Volume delta (buying vs selling pressure) acts as confirmation filter
- Breakout trades only trigger when both price and volume conditions are met
- Mean-reversion exit logic based on VWAP

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry:
  * Price closes ABOVE upper VWAP envelope (VWAP + 2ATR)
  * Volume delta shows significant buying surge (minimum +25% vs 20-period average)
  * Entry on next candle open after confirmation

- Short Entry:
  * Price closes BELOW lower VWAP envelope (VWAP - 2ATR)
  * Volume delta shows significant selling surge (minimum -25% vs 20-period average)
  * Entry on next candle open after confirmation

3. Exit Rules:
- Long Exit:
  * Price crosses back below VWAP line
  * OR price touches lower VWAP envelope (VWAP - 2ATR)

- Short Exit:
  * Price crosses back above VWAP line
  * OR price touches upper VWAP envelope (VWAP + 2ATR)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss placed at opposite envelope boundary (for long: VWAP - 2ATR, for short: VWAP + 2ATR)
- Time-based exit if trade doesn't develop within 3 bars
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

5. Required Indicators:
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
- ATR (14-period recommended)
- Volume delta indicator (buy volume - sell volume)
- 20-period moving average of volume delta for comparison

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
- Works well in trending markets, avoid ranging conditions
- Volume delta confirmation reduces false breakouts
- VWAP acts as dynamic profit target and stop level
- ATR multiple can be adjusted based on market volatility (1.5-3x)
