STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band volatility compression with VWAP-based mean reversion signals, creating a unique approach to trading low-volatility breakouts with volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2σ) to identify volatility compression
2. VWAP as the mean reversion anchor point
3. Volume analysis for confirmation signals
4. Standard deviation channels around VWAP (±2σ)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below its 20-period average (low volatility regime)
2. Enter long when price breaks ABOVE VWAP + 2σ with expanding volume
3. Enter short when price breaks BELOW VWAP - 2σ with expanding volume
4. Volume must be at least 20% higher than 10-period average on breakout

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit when price returns to VWAP with confirming volume
2. Stop loss placed at ±3σ from VWAP (1σ beyond entry point)
3. Emergency exit if Bollinger Band width expands beyond 2x its entry value

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss mandatory on all positions
3. No trading during first/last 30 minutes of session
4. Maximum 3 concurrent positions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. VWAP (daily)
3. Volume (10-period average)
4. Bollinger Band width indicator
5. Standard deviation channels around VWAP (±2σ, ±3σ)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-1hr timeframes
2. Works well in ranging markets with periodic volatility expansions
3. Test different σ multiples (1.5-2.5) for various instruments
4. Volume threshold may need adjustment based on asset liquidity

The VolSqueezeReversion strategy uniquely combines volatility compression detection with volume-weighted mean reversion principles, creating a systematic approach to trading low-volatility breakouts with defined risk parameters.
