STRATEGY_NAME: ChannelMomentumBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with channel-based breakout signals for high-probability entries, using a unique combination of three technical indicators to filter trades.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channel (Primary Filter) - Identifies low volatility periods when breakouts are more significant
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (Trigger) - Confirms momentum direction for breakout validity
3. Bollinger Band %B (Exit Signal) - Provides objective profit-taking and stop-loss levels

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Keltner Channel bandwidth to narrow (indicating consolidation)
2. When price breaks above/below Keltner Channel:
   - Long Entry: Price breaks above upper Keltner Channel AND Chande Oscillator crosses above its signal line
   - Short Entry: Price breaks below lower Keltner Channel AND Chande Oscillator crosses below its signal line

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Long positions: Exit when %B reaches 1.0 (upper Bollinger Band)
   - Short positions: Exit when %B reaches 0.0 (lower Bollinger Band)
2. Stop Loss:
   - Opposite %B extreme (1.0 for shorts, 0.0 for longs) if reached before target
   - Alternative: Channel midpoint as trailing stop

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on volatility (Keltner Channel width)
2. Maximum risk per trade (recommended 1-2% of capital)
3. Avoid trading during news events that may cause false breakouts

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channel (20-period, 2x ATR multiplier)
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-period with 9-period signal line)
3. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) with %B calculation

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust Keltner period length for different timeframes
- Test different signal line periods for Chande Oscillator
- Consider adding volume confirmation for breakouts

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, and should be avoided during strong, established trends where false breakouts are more common.
