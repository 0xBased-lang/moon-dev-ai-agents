STRATEGY_NAME: VolSync Channel

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolSync Channel strategy is a volatility-based approach that combines Keltner Channel breakouts with VWAP deviation analysis for high-probability entries and exits. This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility compression followed by expansion, while using VWAP as a dynamic mean-reversion anchor.

Key Components:
1. Keltner Channels (20-period, 2.5x ATR multiplier)
2. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
3. VWAP Deviation Bands (Â±1 standard deviation)
4. Volatility Filter (Low VWAP deviation condition)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Long Entry:
   - Price closes above upper Keltner Channel
   - Current VWAP deviation is below 0.5 standard deviations
   - Volume is above 20-period average

2. Primary Short Entry:
   - Price closes below lower Keltner Channel
   - Current VWAP deviation is above -0.5 standard deviations
   - Volume is above 20-period average

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target:
   - 1.5x the ATR at time of entry
   - OR when price returns to VWAP centerline

2. Stop Loss:
   - Fixed at 1x ATR from entry price
   - OR when opposite Keltner Channel is breached

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily trades limited to 3
3. No trading during first/last 30 minutes of session
4. Trade only when VWAP bands are tightening (deviation <0.5 std)

Required Indicators:
1. Keltner Channels (20,2.5)
2. VWAP with standard deviation bands (1 std)
3. ATR (14-period)
4. Volume average (20-period)

Special Conditions:
- Avoid trading during earnings announcements
- Higher confidence when breakout occurs with:
  - Consecutive closes outside channel
  - Increasing volume on breakout
  - VWAP flat or sloping in direction of breakout

This strategy works best in trending markets and avoids choppy conditions by requiring both the Keltner breakout and low VWAP deviation simultaneously, creating a volatility synchronization effect that filters out false breakouts.
