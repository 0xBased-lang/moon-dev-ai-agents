STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Order Book Imbalance Analysis:** Identifies clustered liquidation zones where high liquidity is concentrated, indicating potential breakout areas.  
2. **Volume-Weighted Volatility Expansion:** Uses volume-adjusted volatility to confirm breakout strength, filtering false moves.  
3. **Dynamic Support/Resistance Flips:** Adjusts exit points based on real-time shifts in key price levels.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Liquidation Zone Detection:** Monitor order book depth for high liquidity clusters (e.g., large bid/ask stacks) that suggest stop-loss concentrations.  
- **Volatility Trigger:** Enter long/short when price breaks the liquidation zone with:  
  - Volume-weighted volatility (e.g., standard deviation of price changes scaled by volume) expanding above a threshold (e.g., 1.5x the 20-period average).  
  - Confirmation from a surge in trade volume (e.g., > 2x the 10-period median).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Dynamic S/R Flip:** Exit when price closes beyond the opposite side of the breakout zone (e.g., for a long, exit if price closes below the nearest prior support level).  
- **Trailing Stop:** Adjust stop-loss to breakeven once price moves 1.5x the average true range (ATR) in profit.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk â‰¤ 1% of capital per trade.  
- Initial stop-loss: Place at the midpoint of the liquidation zone or 1x ATR from entry, whichever is tighter.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., weekends, pre-market).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Order book depth (liquidation zone mapping).  
2. Volume-weighted volatility (custom calculation).  
3. Average true range (ATR) for stop placement.  
4. Volume surge detector (e.g., rolling Z-score of volume).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines liquidation hunting behavior with quantifiable volatility expansion, reducing false breakouts common in traditional methods.
