STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):**  
   - Uses two lines: VI+ (positive trend movement) and VI- (negative trend movement).  
   - A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-.  
   - A bearish signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+.  

2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):**  
   - Measures buying/selling pressure over a period (typically 20-21 days).  
   - Confirms trend strength when above +0.05 (bullish) or below -0.05 (bearish).  

3. **Keltner Channel (KC):**  
   - Volatility-based bands around an exponential moving average (EMA).  
   - Exit signals occur when price touches or breaches the outer bands, indicating overextension.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI-.  
  - CMF > +0.05 (confirming bullish money flow).  
  - Enter on the next candle’s open.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+.  
  - CMF < -0.05 (confirming bearish money flow).  
  - Enter on the next candle’s open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - Price touches or breaches the upper Keltner Channel band.  
  - Alternatively, if VI- crosses back above VI+ (trend reversal).  

- **Short Exit:**  
  - Price touches or breaches the lower Keltner Channel band.  
  - Alternatively, if VI+ crosses back above VI- (trend reversal).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:**  
  - Place below the recent swing low (long) or above the recent swing high (short).  
  - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- **Position Sizing:**  
  - Adjust based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-).  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF, 20-period).  
3. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend direction (Vortex) with money flow confirmation (CMF) for high-probability entries.  
- Uses Keltner Channel for volatility-based exits, avoiding premature reversals.  
- Avoids choppy markets by requiring alignment of both VI and CMF.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different CMF thresholds (e.g., ±0.02 for more signals or ±0.10 for fewer but stronger ones).  
- Adjust Keltner Channel multiplier (e.g., 1.5x ATR for tighter exits).  
- Apply on higher timeframes (4H/Daily) for smoother trends.
