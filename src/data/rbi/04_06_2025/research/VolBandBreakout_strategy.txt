STRATEGY_NAME: VolBand Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction patterns with volume confirmation to trade high-probability breakout opportunities. The key innovation lies in using TICK volume as a confirmation signal alongside traditional Bollinger Band width analysis.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Identifies consolidation periods when volatility decreases (bands narrow)
2. TICK Volume Confirmation: Requires increasing volume during the contraction phase
3. Volume-Weighted Moving Average: Acts as dynamic support/resistance for exit signals

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width (upper-lower band) to reach lowest 20% of its 50-period range (consolidation)
2. Confirm TICK volume shows rising trend during consolidation (3 consecutive higher lows)
3. Enter long when price breaks above upper Bollinger Band with volume > 20-period average
4. Enter short when price breaks below lower Bollinger Band with volume > 20-period average

Exit Rules:
1. Long positions: Exit when price closes below 20-period VWMA
2. Short positions: Exit when price closes above 20-period VWMA
3. Optional: Trail stop at 2x Bollinger Band width from entry point

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop placed at opposite Bollinger Band (longs: lower band, shorts: upper band)
2. Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade
3. Maximum 5 concurrent positions open

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator
3. TICK Volume indicator
4. Volume-Weighted Moving Average (20 period)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
2. Works well with liquid instruments (forex majors, large cap stocks)
3. Most effective during US/London overlap sessions
4. Filter for ADX < 25 before entry to confirm consolidation

This "VolBand Breakout" strategy offers a systematic approach to trading volatility contractions with volume confirmation, providing clear rules for both entry and risk-managed exits.
