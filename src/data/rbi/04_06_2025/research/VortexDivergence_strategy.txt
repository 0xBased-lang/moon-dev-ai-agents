STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Used to confirm the prevailing trend direction (bullish when VI+ > VI-, bearish when VI- > VI+).  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Identifies money flow divergence (bullish when price makes lower lows but CMF makes higher lows, bearish when price makes higher highs but CMF makes lower highs).  
3. **Bollinger Band Width (BBW):** Measures volatility contraction for exit signals (BBW dropping below a defined threshold indicates reduced momentum).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  - CMF shows bullish divergence (price lower low, CMF higher low).  
  - Enter on the next candle’s open after both conditions align.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  - CMF shows bearish divergence (price higher high, CMF lower high).  
  - Enter on the next candle’s open after both conditions align.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking/Stop-Loss:**  
  - Trailing stop based on recent swing highs/lows or a fixed ATR multiple.  
  - **Primary Exit:** Bollinger Band Width (BBW) contracts below a volatility threshold (e.g., BBW < 0.5 * its 20-period SMA).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade.  
2. Stop-loss:  
   - Long trades: Below the recent swing low or a volatility-based stop (e.g., 1.5x ATR).  
   - Short trades: Above the recent swing high or 1.5x ATR.  
3. Avoid trading during low-volume sessions or major news events.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) – Default period (14).  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) – Default period (20).  
3. Bollinger Bands (BB) – Default settings (20, 2) with BBW derived from band width.  
4. Optional: ATR (14) for dynamic stop-loss.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend confirmation (VI) with smart-money divergence (CMF) and volatility-based exits (BBW) to capture high-probability reversals in trending markets.  

**Note:** Backtest thresholds (e.g., BBW contraction level) should be optimized for specific assets/timeframes.
