STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme contraction in volatility followed by high-volume breakouts, using a combination of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify high-probability trade setups.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Measures volatility compression by tracking the difference between upper and lower Bollinger Bands. A 6-month low indicates extreme consolidation.  
2. **Keltner Channel Breakout:** Confirms momentum by requiring price to close above the Keltner Channel (typically set with a 20-period EMA and 2x ATR).  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Breakout must occur with at least 2x the average volume to validate strong participation.  
4. **Range-Based Profit Target:** Exit at 1.5x the initial breakout range (high-low of the breakout candle).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger: Bollinger Band Width (BBW) reaches its lowest level in 6 months.  
- Confirmation: Price closes above the Keltner Channel upper band.  
- Volume: Breakout candle volume ≥ 2x the 20-day average volume.  
- Entry: Next candle open after confirmation.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Profit Target: 1.5x the height of the breakout candle (high - low).  
- Stop Loss: Below the breakout candle’s low (or Keltner Channel lower band for tighter risk).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position Size: Limit risk to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Stop Placement: Adaptive—wider if volatility is high, tighter if BBW contraction was extreme.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + BBW calculation.  
2. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2x ATR).  
3. Volume average (20-period).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction, channel breakout, and volume surge to filter low-quality setups. The 1.5x range target ensures asymmetric risk/reward.
