STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **3-Day Rate of Change (ROC) Filter:** The strategy identifies extreme price movements when the 3-day ROC exceeds 2 standard deviations of its historical values, signaling strong momentum.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A 50% increase in trading volume compared to the 20-day average volume acts as a confirmation signal, ensuring the price movement is supported by heightened market participation.  
3. **Exit Condition:** The trade is closed when the 1-day ROC turns negative, indicating a loss of upward momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  1. The 3-day ROC exceeds +2 standard deviations of its historical values (calculated over a lookback period, e.g., 60 days).  
  2. The current day's volume is at least 50% higher than the 20-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the position when:  
  1. The 1-day ROC crosses below zero, signaling weakening momentum.  
  2. Alternatively, implement a trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR) to protect profits if the 1-day ROC remains positive but price retraces.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to limit risk exposure.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Set a stop-loss at a recent swing low or a multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) to protect against adverse moves.  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Exit the trade if the 1-day ROC does not turn negative within a set number of days (e.g., 5 days) to avoid stagnation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Rate of Change (ROC):**  
   - 3-day ROC for entry signal.  
   - 1-day ROC for exit signal.  
2. **Volume:**  
   - 20-day average volume for comparison.  
3. **Standard Deviation:**  
   - Historical standard deviation of the 3-day ROC (e.g., 60-day lookback).  
4. **Optional:**  
   - Average True Range (ATR) for dynamic stop-loss placement.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines extreme momentum (ROC) with volume confirmation to filter high-probability trades.  
- Exits early on momentum loss (1-day ROC < 0) to lock in gains and avoid reversals.  
- Adaptable to volatile markets by focusing on statistical extremes.  

**Note:** Backtest the strategy with different standard deviation thresholds (e.g., 1.5x or 2.5x) and volume surge percentages to optimize for specific assets or market conditions.
