STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on volatility contractions during low liquidity periods, combining Bollinger Bandwidth analysis with VWAP slope confirmation and volume triggers. Here's the detailed breakdown:

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) to identify periods of contraction
2. Liquidity Filter: Focuses on low liquidity periods (overnight/early session)
3. Confirmation: Requires positive VWAP slope for bullish bias (negative for bearish)
4. Trigger: Volume surge exceeding 20-day average volume
5. Risk Management: 2x ATR stop-loss

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for BBW to reach lowest 20% of its 50-day range (volatility contraction)
2. Confirm VWAP slope is positive (for long) or negative (for short)
3. Enter when volume exceeds 20-day average by at least 50%
4. Entry occurs on the first full candle after volume surge confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: 2x ATR trailing stop from entry point
2. Secondary Exit: When BBW expands beyond median levels (50% of 50-day range)
3. Emergency Exit: Immediate exit if volume drops below 20-day average for 3 consecutive candles

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 3%
3. No new entries after 2 consecutive losing trades
4. Weekend position closure rule (flat before Friday close)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for Bandwidth calculation
2. VWAP with 1-period slope calculation
3. 20-day volume average
4. ATR (14-period) for stop calculation
5. Volume histogram

Optimization Notes:
- Best performance in forex and index futures during Asian/London overlap
- Requires adjustment of BBW threshold for different asset classes
- VWAP slope period can be optimized between 3-5 periods
- Volume surge multiplier can be adjusted between 1.5-3x based on asset volatility

Additional Filters:
- Avoid FOMC/earnings days
- Requires minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio
- Only trade when overall market is in "normal" volatility regime (VIX between 12-30)

This strategy combines mean-reversion principles (volatility contraction) with momentum triggers (volume surge), creating a high-probability setup during typically lower-activity market periods.
