STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationVolBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines liquidation cluster analysis with volatility contraction patterns to identify high-probability breakout opportunities in futures markets. The approach focuses on areas where price approaches significant liquidation levels while exhibiting reduced volatility, then enters when volatility expands beyond a defined threshold.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Detection: Identifies price levels with high liquidity concentrations where forced liquidations are likely to occur
2. Volatility Contraction: Uses Bollinger Bands Width to measure periods of compressed volatility
3. Breakout Confirmation: Requires price to break through both the liquidation cluster and volatility threshold

Entry Rules:
1. Price must approach within 1% of a identified high liquidation cluster level
2. Bollinger Bands Width (20,2) must be below its 20-period moving average (volatility contraction)
3. Entry triggered when:
   - Price breaks above liquidation cluster level
   - AND Bollinger Bands Width expands above its 20-period moving average
   - Volume must be above average on breakout candle

Exit Rules:
1. Initial target: 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry point
2. Secondary target: 2.5x ATR with partial position closing
3. Stop loss placed at:
   - 0.5x ATR below entry for long positions
   - 0.5x ATR above entry for short positions
4. Trailing stop activates after price reaches 1x ATR profit

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Avoid trading during major economic news events

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation cluster heatmap (proprietary or exchange-provided)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with Width calculation
3. 20-period moving average of Bollinger Bands Width
4. Average True Range (14-period)
5. Volume indicator with 20-period average

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes in liquid futures markets
2. Works particularly well in trending market conditions
3. Requires periodic recalibration of volatility thresholds based on current market conditions
4. Performance improves when combined with order flow analysis for confirmation
