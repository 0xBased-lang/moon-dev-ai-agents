STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Spike Detection:** The strategy identifies spikes in short liquidations that are 3x above the 30-day average. This indicates potential market exhaustion and a possible reversal point.  
2. **RSI Divergence Confirmation:** Simultaneously, the strategy looks for bullish RSI divergence (price making lower lows while RSI makes higher lows) to confirm weakening downward momentum.  
3. **Exit Based on Liquidation Candle Range:** The exit is set at 1.5x the range of the liquidation candle, ensuring a favorable risk-reward ratio.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  - Short liquidations spike to 3x the 30-day average.  
  - Bullish RSI divergence is present (price lower low, RSI higher low).  
  - The entry is triggered on the close of the liquidation spike candle.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the long position when the price reaches 1.5x the range of the liquidation candle (high - low of that candle).  
- Alternatively, exit if RSI crosses below 50, indicating weakening bullish momentum.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss is placed at 0.5x the range of the liquidation candle to limit downside risk.  
- Position sizing should be adjusted to ensure risk per trade is â‰¤1-2% of the trading capital.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Liquidation Data:** Real-time or historical short liquidation data (e.g., from exchanges or APIs like Bybit, Binance, or Coinglass).  
2. **RSI (14-period):** To identify divergence and confirm momentum shifts.  
3. **Price Action:** Candlestick charts to determine the liquidation candle range.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in highly leveraged markets (e.g., crypto) where liquidations have a pronounced impact.  
- Backtest across multiple assets to validate robustness.  
- Avoid using during low-liquidity periods to prevent false signals.  

The unique combination of liquidation spikes and RSI divergence makes this a high-probability reversal strategy.
