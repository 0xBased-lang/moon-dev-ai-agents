STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidity Zones Identification:** The strategy focuses on clustered liquidation levels, which act as significant liquidity zones. These zones are areas where a large number of stop orders are likely clustered, making them key levels for potential breakouts.  
2. **Volatility Contraction Pattern:** The strategy uses Bollinger Band Width (BBW) to identify periods of low volatility. A breakout is considered valid when BBW is at a 1-year low, indicating a potential expansion in volatility.  
3. **Breakout Confirmation:** The trade is triggered when price exits the identified liquidity zone following a volatility contraction, signaling a potential strong directional move.  
4. **Targeting Liquidity Pockets:** The profit target is set at the next visible liquidity pocket, which is another significant level where price might reverse or consolidate.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Identify Liquidity Zones:** Use order flow analysis or historical price action to locate clustered liquidation levels (key support/resistance zones where stop orders are likely clustered).  
2. **Volatility Contraction:** Confirm that Bollinger Band Width (BBW) is at a 1-year low, indicating a period of extreme contraction in volatility.  
3. **Breakout Trigger:** Enter the trade when price breaks out of the identified liquidity zone with confirmation (e.g., closing outside the zone or a strong candlestick pattern).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Exit the trade when price reaches the next visible liquidity pocket (another significant level where price might reverse or consolidate).  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place the stop loss below/above the liquidity zone (for long/short trades) to protect against false breakouts.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Use a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% per trade) to manage risk.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Set the stop loss at a logical level beyond the liquidity zone to avoid being stopped out by minor retracements.  
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio:** Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio, ensuring that potential profits outweigh potential losses.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (BB):** To calculate Bollinger Band Width (BBW) and identify volatility contraction.  
2. **Order Flow Tools or Historical Data:** To identify clustered liquidation levels (liquidity zones).  
3. **Price Action Analysis:** To confirm breakout validity and identify next liquidity pockets for profit targets.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets where liquidity zones are clearly defined.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., holidays or off-hours) to reduce slippage and false breakouts.  
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes and asset classes to ensure robustness.  

By combining liquidity analysis with volatility contraction, the LiquidityBreakout strategy aims to capitalize on high-probability breakout opportunities with well-defined risk parameters.
