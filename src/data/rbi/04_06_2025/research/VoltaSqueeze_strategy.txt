STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Squeeze Detection:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) contract below a 20-period historical volatility threshold (e.g., Keltner Channels or ATR-based threshold).  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** A long entry is triggered when price closes above the upper Bollinger Band after a squeeze, while a short entry is triggered when price closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  
3. **Trailing Stop Exit:** Positions are managed using a trailing stop based on the Average True Range (ATR) (e.g., 2x ATR(14) trailing from the extreme price point).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Bollinger Bands width (Upper Band - Lower Band) is below the 20-period historical volatility threshold.  
  - Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - Bollinger Bands width is below the 20-period historical volatility threshold.  
  - Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:**  
  - Trailing stop-loss set at 2x ATR(14) below the highest high since entry.  
  - Optional: Take-profit at a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
- **Short Exit:**  
  - Trailing stop-loss set at 2x ATR(14) above the lowest low since entry.  
  - Optional: Take-profit at a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on a fixed percentage of account risk (e.g., 1% per trade).  
- Stop-loss dynamically adjusts with volatility (ATR-based trailing stop).  
- Avoid trading during major news events or extreme market gaps.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20, 2)** – To detect squeeze conditions.  
2. **Historical Volatility Threshold (20-period)** – To confirm low volatility (can be derived from Keltner Channels or ATR).  
3. **Average True Range (ATR 14)** – For trailing stop placement.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation.  
- Avoid using in choppy or mean-reverting conditions.  
- Backtest optimal ATR multiplier for trailing stops (e.g., 1.5x vs. 2x).  

This strategy capitalizes on volatility contraction followed by expansion, with strict risk controls via ATR-based trailing stops.
