STRATEGY_NAME: HAVOC Momentum (Heikin-Ashi Volume-Controlled Momentum)

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This intraday momentum strategy combines three powerful technical elements to identify high-probability trades with controlled risk. The name "HAVOC" reflects its core components: Heikin-Ashi candles, Volume analysis, and Oscillator confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Candle Direction - Smoothed price action filter
2. True Strength Index (TSI) Divergence - Momentum confirmation
3. Volume-Weighted VWAP Break - Institutional activity signal
4. Parabolic SAR - Trend-exhaustion exit signal

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Heikin-Ashi candle turns green (bullish)
2. TSI shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low while TSI makes higher low)
3. Price breaks above VWAP with above-average volume
4. All three conditions must align within the same 15-30 minute candle

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Heikin-Ashi candle turns red (bearish)
2. TSI shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high while TSI makes lower high)
3. Price breaks below VWAP with above-average volume
4. All three conditions must align within the same 15-30 minute candle

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Parabolic SAR dot flips to opposite side of trade
2. Secondary Exit: Fixed 1:2 risk/reward ratio (adjust stop to breakeven after 1R move)
3. Emergency Exit: Heikin-Ashi candle color change opposite to trade direction

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop placed at recent swing low/high (for long/short respectively)
2. Position size limited to 1-2% of account per trade
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
4. No trading during first/last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (smoothed price action)
2. True Strength Index (14,25 settings recommended)
3. Volume-Weighted VWAP (20-period)
4. Parabolic SAR (0.02 step, 0.2 maximum)
5. Volume indicator (for confirmation)

Optimal Timeframe:
15-30 minute charts for intraday trading, best applied to liquid instruments with strong trending characteristics (ES futures, major forex pairs, large-cap stocks).

Strategy Advantages:
- Triple confirmation reduces false signals
- Heikin-Ashi filters out market noise
- Volume confirmation adds institutional validity
- Clear mechanical exit rules

Strategy Limitations:
- May underperform in choppy, range-bound markets
- Requires careful monitoring of multiple indicators
- Volume spikes can sometimes produce false breaks

Recommended Filters:
1. Only trade in direction of higher timeframe trend (use 1hr/4hr chart alignment)
2. Avoid trading during major news events
3. Focus on most liquid trading sessions (London/NY overlap for forex, US hours for equities)
