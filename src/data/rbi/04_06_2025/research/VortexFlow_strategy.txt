STRATEGY_NAME: VortexFlow  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):**  
   - VI+ (Positive Vortex) measures upward trend movement.  
   - VI- (Negative Vortex) measures downward trend movement.  
   - A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-.  
   - A bearish signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+.  

2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):**  
   - Confirms the strength of the trend by measuring buying/selling pressure.  
   - A positive CMF (above zero) confirms bullish momentum.  
   - A negative CMF (below zero) confirms bearish momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI-.  
  - CMF is above zero (confirming bullish money flow).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+.  
  - CMF is below zero (confirming bearish money flow).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** VI- crosses back above VI+ (trend reversal signal).  
- **Short Exit:** VI+ crosses back above VI- (trend reversal signal).  
- Optional: Use a trailing stop or fixed risk percentage (e.g., 2% per trade).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss below recent swing low (long) or above recent swing high (short).  
- Position sizing based on account risk (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low CMF values (near zero) to filter weak signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-).  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF, 20-period default).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; avoid choppy/range-bound conditions.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for stronger signals.  
- Backtest optimal CMF threshold (e.g., >0.1 for stronger confirmation).  

This strategy leverages the synergy between trend direction (Vortex) and money flow strength (CMF) for high-probability entries.
