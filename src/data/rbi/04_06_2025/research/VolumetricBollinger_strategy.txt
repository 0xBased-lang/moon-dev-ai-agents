STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBollinger  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands, ADX, volume analysis, and Chandelier Exit for a systematic mean-reversion approach with momentum confirmation.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – Identifies overbought/oversold levels  
2. **ADX (14-period)** – Filters for trending conditions (must rise above 25)  
3. **Volume (30-day SMA)** – Confirms participation in the move  
4. **Chandelier Exit (3xATR, 22-period)** – Dynamic trailing stop mechanism  

**Entry Rules (Long Only):**  
1. Price must touch or penetrate the lower Bollinger Band  
2. ADX must be rising AND cross above 25 (confirming trend strength)  
3. Current volume must exceed 30-day average volume  
4. All three conditions must occur simultaneously  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Primary Exit:** Price reaches upper Bollinger Band (take profit)  
2. **Protective Exit:** Chandelier Exit trailing stop (3xATR) triggers  
3. **Emergency Exit:** If ADX falls below 20 after entry (trend weakening)  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade  
- Initial stop placed at recent swing low (below lower Bollinger Band)  
- Trailing stop activates once price moves >1.5xATR in profit  
- No entries if VIX is above 30 (high volatility filter)  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)  
2. ADX (14-period)  
3. Volume + 30-day SMA volume  
4. ATR (22-period for Chandelier)  
5. VIX (optional volatility filter)  

**Optimal Conditions:**  
- Works best in ranging markets with occasional volatility expansions  
- Avoid during strong bear trends (ADX >35 and falling prices)  
- Most effective on liquid assets with consistent volume patterns  

**Unique Advantages:**  
- Volume filter prevents false breakouts  
- ADX confirms genuine trend strength  
- Chandelier Exit locks in profits during extended moves  
- Combines mean-reversion (Bollinger) with trend-following (ADX) elements
