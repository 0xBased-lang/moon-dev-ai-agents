STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricSqueeze strategy combines volume anomaly detection with volatility compression to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. This approach waits for two rare but powerful conditions to align before entering trades.

Key Components:
1. Volume Spike Detection (Trigger):
   - Uses 4-hour timeframe for significant moves
   - Compares current volume to historical distribution
   - Requires volume exceeding 90th percentile (top 10% of all volume readings)

2. Volatility Contraction (Confirmation):
   - Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) must contract below 0.5%
   - BBW = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band
   - Indicates extreme compression before potential expansion

3. Exit Mechanism:
   - Uses trailing stops based on Average True Range (ATR)
   - Allows profits to run during volatility expansion
   - Automatically protects gains when trend reverses

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Current 4H volume > 90th percentile of last 100 periods
   - Simultaneous BBW reading < 0.5%
   - Enter at market price after both conditions confirm

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing Stop:
   - Initial stop: 1.5x current ATR(14) below entry
   - Trails upward at 0.75x ATR(14) as price moves favorably
   - Never moves downward (only ratchets up)

2. Emergency Stop:
   - Hard stop at 2.5x ATR(14) below entry
   - Triggers if price moves violently against position

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Calculate position size based on distance to emergency stop

2. Trade Frequency:
   - Expect 1-3 setups per month per instrument
   - Avoid overtrading by waiting for quality signals

Required Indicators:
1. Volume (standard indicator)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 settings for BBW calculation)
3. ATR (14-period for stop calculations)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different percentile thresholds (85th-95th)
- Experiment with BBW contraction levels (0.3%-0.7%)
- Adjust ATR multiples based on instrument volatility

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive potential when unusually high trading interest (volume spike) coincides with extreme price compression (low BBW), creating a high-probability setup for directional moves. The ATR-based exit allows participation in extended trends while protecting capital.
