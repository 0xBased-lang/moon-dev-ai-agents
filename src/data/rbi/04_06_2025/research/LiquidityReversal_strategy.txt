STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **24-Hour High/Low Breach:** The strategy focuses on price breaking the highest or lowest point of the last 24 hours, indicating a potential extreme in market movement.  
2. **Volume Spike (200%+):** A significant surge in trading volume (at least double the average) confirms strong participation, increasing the likelihood of a reversal.  
3. **RSI Divergence:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) must show divergence (price makes a new high/low but RSI does not), signaling weakening momentum.  
4. **Liquidity Gap Targeting:** The strategy aims for clustered stop-loss levels (liquidity pools) beyond recent highs/lows, where price often reverses due to order flow imbalances.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - Price breaches the 24-hour low.  
  - Volume spikes ≥200% above recent average.  
  - RSI shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low).  
  - Enter on a confirming candle (e.g., bullish engulfing or hammer) near the liquidity zone.  

- **Short Entry:**  
  - Price breaches the 24-hour high.  
  - Volume spikes ≥200% above recent average.  
  - RSI shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high).  
  - Enter on a confirming candle (e.g., bearish engulfing or shooting star) near the liquidity zone.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Target the nearest liquidity gap (identified via order book analysis or recent swing highs/lows where stop clusters are likely).  
- **Stop Loss:** Place below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the recent swing high (for shorts), ensuring a favorable risk-reward ratio (minimum 1:2).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size should not exceed 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., holidays, overnight sessions).  
- Filter trades with high volatility (e.g., ATR > recent average) to avoid false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **24-Hour High/Low:** Tracked via price action or custom indicator.  
2. **Volume Spike:** Compare current volume to a 20-period moving average.  
3. **RSI (14-period):** Set to standard settings, watch for divergence.  
4. **Order Flow Tools (optional):** Depth of Market (DOM) or footprint charts to identify liquidity gaps.  

**Unique Edge:** This strategy exploits institutional stop hunts and retail trader overreactions, combining volume confirmation, RSI divergence, and liquidity-based targets for high-probability reversals.
