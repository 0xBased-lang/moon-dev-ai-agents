STRATEGY_NAME: BandChannelBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, volume analysis, Parabolic SAR, and RSI divergence to identify high-probability breakout trades with built-in confirmation filters and trailing stop management.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Measures volatility contraction
2. Keltner Channels (20,1.5) - Defines the breakout range
3. Volume Percentile (90th) - Confirms breakout strength
4. Parabolic SAR (0.02,0.2) - Provides trailing stop mechanism
5. RSI (14) - Identifies divergence for confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract INSIDE Keltner Channels (volatility squeeze)
2. Price must break above upper Keltner Channel (long) or below lower Keltner Channel (short)
3. Volume must exceed its 90-day 90th percentile on breakout
4. RSI must show bullish divergence (for longs) or bearish divergence (for shorts)
   - Bullish: Higher low in price with lower low in RSI
   - Bearish: Lower high in price with higher high in RSI

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Follow Parabolic SAR dots as trailing stop
2. Secondary Exit: If RSI crosses back over 50 (for longs) or under 50 (for shorts)
3. Emergency Exit: If price returns inside Keltner Channel after breakout

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1-2% risk of capital
2. Initial stop placed at opposite Keltner Channel band
3. Trailing stop activates immediately using Parabolic SAR
4. Maximum trade duration of 5 days (prevents overexposure)

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 period, 2 std dev
- Keltner Channels: 20 period, 1.5 ATR multiplier
- Volume: 90-day lookback period, 90th percentile threshold
- Parabolic SAR: 0.02 step, 0.2 maximum
- RSI: 14 period

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Most effective on 1-hour to daily timeframes
- Ideal for liquid stocks/forex pairs with consistent volume patterns
- Avoid during major news events when volatility spikes unpredictably
