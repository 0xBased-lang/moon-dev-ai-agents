STRATEGY_NAME: FibroDeltaBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidity Void Detection:** Uses clustered Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) to identify zones where price may have left unfilled orders, creating potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Order Book Imbalance Confirmation:** Requires visible order book imbalance (e.g., large bid/ask stack asymmetry) near the Fibonacci cluster to validate the liquidity void.  
3. **Cumulative Delta Divergence:** Confirms breakout validity by checking for divergences between price action and cumulative delta volume (e.g., price makes higher highs while delta volume shows lower highs, signaling weakening momentum).  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Breakout Trigger:** Enter long/short when price breaks above/below the Fibonacci cluster zone with a closing candle confirmation.  
2. **Delta Confirmation:** The breakout must coincide with a divergence in cumulative delta volume (e.g., bullish divergence for long entries, bearish for short).  
3. **Order Book Alignment:** The breakout direction should align with the order book imbalance (e.g., breakout above a cluster with a large ask stack depletion).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Use Fibonacci extensions (e.g., 127.2%, 161.8%) or nearby liquidity pools as take-profit zones.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place stops below/above the opposite side of the Fibonacci cluster or recent swing low/high.  
3. **Delta Reversal Signal:** Exit if cumulative delta volume shows a reversal pattern (e.g., sharp delta spike against the trade direction).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Placement:** Ensure stop-loss is outside the Fibonacci cluster to avoid premature exits from minor retests.  
3. **False Breakout Filter:** Avoid entering if the breakout lacks order book or delta confirmation.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool** (clustered levels).  
2. **Order Book Depth Chart** (for imbalance detection).  
3. **Cumulative Delta Volume Indicator** (for divergence analysis).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines Fibonacci liquidity voids with real-time order flow (delta + order book) to filter high-probability breakouts, reducing false signals common in pure price-action strategies.
