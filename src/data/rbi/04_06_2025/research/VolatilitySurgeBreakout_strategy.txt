STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume skewness analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The approach capitalizes on periods of extreme compression in volatility followed by confirmation through unusual volume activity.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth (20-period, 2 std dev) at 6-month lows
2. Volume skewness indicator showing significant deviation from mean
3. ATR (14-period) for stop placement
4. Price breaking through either Bollinger Band

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Bandwidth reaches its lowest point in 6 months (120 trading days)
2. Confirmation: Volume skewness shows >2 standard deviation move from 20-day average
3. Execution: Enter long when price closes above upper band (for bullish breakout) or short when price closes below lower band (for bearish breakout)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: Opposite band touch (for long: exit at lower band touch, for short: exit at upper band touch)
2. Stop Loss: 2x current 14-period ATR from entry price
3. Time Exit: Close position if neither target nor stop is hit within 5 days

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk of account per trade (using ATR stop distance)
2. Maximum of 3 concurrent positions
3. No new entries if account drawdown exceeds 5%

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2 std dev)
3. Volume skewness (20-period z-score)
4. ATR (14-period)
5. 120-day historical bandwidth reference

Optimization Notes:
- Test different bandwidth lookback periods (3-9 months)
- Experiment with volume skewness thresholds (1.5-3 std dev)
- Consider adding RSI filter (e.g., require RSI <30 for long breakouts, >70 for short breakouts)

This strategy is particularly effective in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases, with the volume skewness component helping filter false breakouts. The tight stop relative to target provides favorable risk-reward dynamics.
