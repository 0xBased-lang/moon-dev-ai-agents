STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator Crossover**: Uses VI+ (positive trend) and VI- (negative trend) lines to identify trend direction. A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-, while a bearish signal occurs when VI- crosses above VI+.  
2. **Choppiness Index (CI) Filter**: Confirms trending conditions when CI < 38, indicating the market is not in a choppy or range-bound phase.  
3. **Bollinger Band Width Squeeze**: Identifies low volatility periods when the Bollinger Band width (BBW) contracts to a 10-day low, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
4. **Exit Condition**: Monitors Bollinger Band expansion, exiting trades when BBW exceeds 1.5x the width at entry.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish vortex signal).  
  2. Choppiness Index < 38 (confirms trending environment).  
  3. Bollinger Band width (BBW) reaches a 10-day low (volatility squeeze).  
- **Short Entry**:  
  1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish vortex signal).  
  2. Choppiness Index < 38 (confirms trending environment).  
  3. Bollinger Band width (BBW) reaches a 10-day low (volatility squeeze).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit**: Bollinger Band width expands to >1.5x the width at entry.  
- **Short Exit**: Bollinger Band width expands to >1.5x the width at entry.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a stop-loss at the recent swing low (for longs) or swing high (for shorts) to limit downside risk.  
- Position sizing should align with volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing) to avoid overexposure during low-volatility setups.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)** – For trend direction confirmation.  
2. **Choppiness Index (CI)** – To filter out choppy market conditions.  
3. **Bollinger Bands (BBW)** – To identify volatility contractions and expansions.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (Vortex + Choppiness) with volatility-based timing (Bollinger Squeeze).  
- Exits on volatility expansion rather than fixed price targets, capturing extended trends while avoiding premature exits.  
- Avoids range-bound markets by requiring CI < 38, ensuring trades align with strong trends.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Adjust the CI threshold (e.g., 35-40) based on asset volatility.  
- Test different BBW expansion multiples (1.3x-2x) for exit sensitivity.  
- Backtest across multiple timeframes to validate robustness.
