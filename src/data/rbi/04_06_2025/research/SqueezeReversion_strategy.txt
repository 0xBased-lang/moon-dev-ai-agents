STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on potential short squeeze opportunities in perpetual futures markets by identifying extreme negative funding rates combined with declining open interest. The approach combines mean-reversion principles with crowd psychology dynamics in derivatives markets.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Extremes: Focuses on periods when funding rates reach statistically significant negative levels (typically below -0.1% per 8h period)
2. Open Interest Dynamics: Requires concurrent sharp decline in open interest (minimum 15-20% drop from recent highs)
3. Price Action Confirmation: Looks for stabilization or bullish reversal patterns after recent downward movement

Entry Rules:
- Trigger when 8h funding rate ≤ -0.1% (adjustable parameter)
- Concurrent open interest must show ≥15% decline from 7-day high
- Price should show signs of stabilization (e.g., bullish engulfing pattern or break above recent resistance)
- Optional confirmation: RSI(14) < 30 (oversold condition)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking:
- Primary: 5-8% fixed gain threshold (adjustable based on volatility)
- Secondary: When funding rate crosses above -0.05% (normalization)
2. Stop-loss:
- 3-5% below entry price (tighter than profit target)
- Or break below recent swing low

Risk Management:
- Position sizing: 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum portfolio exposure: 5% across all concurrent positions
- Avoid entering during major macroeconomic events
- Time-based exit if position doesn't move favorably within 48h

Required Indicators:
1. Perpetual futures funding rate (8h periods)
2. Open interest (OI) data
3. Optional: RSI(14) for confirmation
4. Price chart patterns (candlestick analysis)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust funding rate threshold based on asset volatility
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
- May implement tiered profit-taking (e.g., 50% at 5%, 50% at 8%)
- Backtest optimal OI decline percentage for specific assets

This strategy works best in:
- High-liquidity perpetual contracts
- Assets with historically volatile funding rates
- During periods of excessive bearish sentiment
- When combined with broader market structure analysis
