STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaBandwidth strategy is a sophisticated volatility-based trading system that combines Bollinger Band dynamics with RSI and volume-weighted moving averages for precise entry and exit signals.

Key Components:
1. Dynamic Bollinger Band Width Threshold: Uses standard deviation-based bands to identify volatility breakouts
2. RSI Filter: Confirms overbought/oversold conditions for exit signals
3. Volume-Weighted MA: Adds liquidity confirmation to trade exits
4. Dual Timeframe Analysis: Requires alignment across different timeframes for higher probability trades

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Price must close above upper Bollinger Band
2. Band width must be expanding (current width > previous width)
3. Volume must be above 20-period average
4. RSI must be below 70 (not yet overbought)

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Price must close below lower Bollinger Band
2. Band width must be expanding (current width > previous width)
3. Volume must be above 20-period average
4. RSI must be above 30 (not yet oversold)

Exit Rules (Long Positions):
1. RSI crosses below 70 from above (overbought signal)
2. Price closes below Volume-Weighted MA (20-period)
3. Band width contracts by 15% from entry width
4. Whichever condition occurs first

Exit Rules (Short Positions):
1. RSI crosses above 30 from below (oversold signal)
2. Price closes above Volume-Weighted MA (20-period)
3. Band width contracts by 15% from entry width
4. Whichever condition occurs first

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop-loss at 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry
2. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 3%
4. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. RSI (14-period)
3. Volume-Weighted Moving Average (20-period)
4. Average True Range (14-period)
5. Volume indicator

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
2. Works well with liquid assets (forex majors, large-cap stocks)
3. Requires volatility to be present (avoid ranging markets)
4. Backtest suggested parameters before live trading

The VoltaBandwidth strategy excels in trending markets with expanding volatility, using the unique combination of band width expansion, RSI confirmation, and volume-weighted exits to capture strong moves while avoiding false breakouts.
