STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines multiple technical indicators to identify high-probability breakout trades with strong momentum confirmation. The core approach uses the Vortex Indicator for directional signals, On-Balance Volume for confirmation of buying/selling pressure, and ADX for trend strength validation.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines) - Primary directional signal
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) - Volume confirmation
3. Average Directional Index (ADX) - Trend strength filter
4. Risk-reward ratio (2:1) - Profit-taking mechanism
5. Trailing stop-loss - Exit mechanism

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish Vortex crossover)
2. OBV is making higher highs (increasing buying pressure)
3. ADX > 30 (strong trend confirmation)
4. Price breaks above recent resistance level

SHORT ENTRY:
1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish Vortex crossover)
2. OBV is making lower highs (increasing selling pressure)
3. ADX > 30 (strong trend confirmation)
4. Price breaks below recent support level

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit at 2:1 risk-reward ratio (target = 2x initial risk)
2. Trailing stop-loss activated after price moves 1x risk in profit
3. Immediate exit if ADX drops below 25 (trend weakening)

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop-loss placed at recent swing low (long) or swing high (short)
2. Position size calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
3. No new entries if ADX is below 25 (avoid ranging markets)

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (default 14-period)
2. On-Balance Volume
3. ADX (14-period)
4. Price chart with clear support/resistance levels

Optimization Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets (commodities, indices)
- Less effective in choppy or ranging conditions
- Consider combining with candlestick patterns for additional confirmation

This strategy provides a systematic approach to trading breakouts with multiple confirmation layers, focusing on high-probability setups with favorable risk-reward ratios. The combination of directional indicators (Vortex), volume confirmation (OBV), and trend strength (ADX) creates a robust framework for identifying and managing trades.
