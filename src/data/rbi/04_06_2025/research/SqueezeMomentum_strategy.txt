STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with momentum confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during low volatility periods. The key components work together to filter out false breakouts and identify genuine trend initiations.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies periods of contraction (squeeze)
2. ADX (14) - Measures trend strength, looking for values below 25
3. Volume - Compared to 30-day moving average
4. MACD (12,26,9) - Confirms breakout direction

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band squeeze (upper and lower bands within 5% of each other)
2. Confirm ADX is declining and below 25 (indicating weak/no trend)
3. Verify volume is below 30-day average (showing contraction)
4. Enter long when:
   - Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band
   - MACD shows bullish crossover (signal line crosses above MACD line)
5. Enter short when:
   - Price breaks below lower Bollinger Band
   - MACD shows bearish crossover (signal line crosses below MACD line)

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions:
   - Take profit when price touches upper band again after breakout
   - Stop loss at lower Bollinger Band or 2% below entry (whichever is closer)
2. For short positions:
   - Take profit when price touches lower band again after breakout
   - Stop loss at upper Bollinger Band or 2% above entry (whichever is closer)

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Avoid trading during major news events

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
2. ADX (14 periods)
3. Volume + 30-day moving average of volume
4. MACD (12,26,9 settings)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Most effective in ranging markets transitioning to trending
- Requires patience as squeezes may take time to develop
- Works well with liquid assets (major forex pairs, large-cap stocks)
