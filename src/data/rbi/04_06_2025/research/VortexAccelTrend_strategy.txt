STRATEGY_NAME: VortexAccelTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation from the Vortex Indicator with volume acceleration to identify high-probability trade entries, using a dynamic trailing stop for exits.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines) - Primary trend confirmation tool
2. Volume Acceleration - 3-day volume change exceeding 20% threshold
3. ATR (Average True Range) - For dynamic position sizing and stop placement

Entry Rules:
LONG:
- When VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation)
- AND 3-day volume acceleration > 20% (calculated as: (Today's Volume - 3-day MA Volume)/3-day MA Volume > 0.2)

SHORT:
- When VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation)
- AND 3-day volume acceleration > 20% (same calculation as long)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Opposite Vortex crossover (VI+ crosses below VI- for long positions or VI- crosses below VI+ for short positions)
2. Protective Exit: Trailing stop at 2x ATR from the most recent extreme:
   - For longs: High price - (2 x ATR)
   - For shorts: Low price + (2 x ATR)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade using ATR:
   - Position Size = (Account Risk per Trade) / (2 x ATR)
2. Maximum portfolio exposure: 5 concurrent positions
3. Daily time frame recommended for reduced noise

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (default 14-period)
2. Volume (for acceleration calculation)
3. ATR (14-period recommended)

Optimization Notes:
- Volume acceleration threshold can be adjusted between 15-25% based on market volatility
- ATR multiplier can be tested between 1.5-2.5 for stop sensitivity
- Strategy performs best in trending markets, may underperform in ranging conditions

Additional Filters (optional):
- Can add 200-day MA filter to only trade in direction of primary trend
- Can require RSI(14) between 30-70 to avoid overbought/oversold conditions
