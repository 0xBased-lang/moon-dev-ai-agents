STRATEGY_NAME: VortexFlowTrail

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum confirmation with money flow analysis and dynamic risk management. The key components are:

1. INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines, default 14-period)
- Chaikin Money Flow (CMF, default 20-period)
- Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)

2. ENTRY RULES:
- Primary Condition: VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish momentum signal)
- Secondary Confirmation: CMF crosses above zero (positive money flow)
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously for valid entry

3. EXIT MECHANISM:
- Uses a trailing stop based on volatility
- Stop level = Current price - (2 × 14-period ATR)
- Stop trails upward as price moves favorably
- No profit target - lets winners run until stopped out

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Initial stop distance (2×ATR) provides natural position sizing
- Volatility-adjusted stop adapts to market conditions
- No additional entries while in position (single trade approach)

5. KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Dual confirmation reduces false signals
- Volatility-based exit captures trends while protecting gains
- Particularly effective in trending markets with strong volume participation
- Works best on daily or 4-hour timeframes for swing trading

6. OPTIMIZATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- Can test different ATR multiples (1.5-3×) for stop sensitivity
- May adjust CMF period (14-30) for smoother money flow signals
- VI period can be optimized (10-20) for different instruments

This strategy excels when momentum and money flow align, while the ATR-based trailing stop provides disciplined risk management. The combination makes it particularly effective for capturing sustained trends while minimizing emotional decision-making.
