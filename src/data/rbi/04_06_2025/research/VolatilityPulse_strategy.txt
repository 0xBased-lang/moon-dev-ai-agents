STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityPulse strategy is a specialized volatility-based trading approach that combines ATR dynamics with VIX sentiment analysis for precise entries and disciplined exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses 5-minute ATR (14-period) to gauge short-term volatility
2. Trend Filter: 20-period moving average of ATR identifies volatility expansion
3. Sentiment Indicator: VIX 10-day average acts as market fear gauge
4. Exit Mechanism: 2x ATR trailing stop locks in profits while allowing room for volatility

Entry Rules:
1. LONG Entry Trigger:
   - 5-minute ATR (14-period) crosses ABOVE its 20-period moving average
   - Current VIX value is BELOW its 10-day simple moving average
   - Both conditions must be met simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit:
   - 2x ATR (14-period) trailing stop from the most recent peak
   - Stop updates with each new price high
2. Optional Time Exit (recommended):
   - Close position after 4 hours if stop not hit
   - Prevents overnight risk exposure

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Calculate position size based on 2x ATR stop distance
2. Maximum Exposure:
   - No more than 3 concurrent positions
   - Avoid trading during major news events
3. Time Filter:
   - Only trade during active market hours (9:30am-3:30pm ET)

Required Indicators:
1. Primary Indicators:
   - ATR (14-period) on 5-minute chart
   - 20-period SMA of ATR
2. Sentiment Filter:
   - VIX index
   - 10-day SMA of VIX
3. Recommended Additional Tools:
   - Volume profile to confirm interest at entry levels
   - 200-period EMA as overall trend context

Optimization Notes:
1. Best performing in:
   - SPY, QQQ, IWM ETFs
   - Liquid large-cap stocks
2. Ideal market conditions:
   - Transitioning from low to moderate volatility
   - Avoid high VIX environments (>25)
3. Backtest Parameters:
   - Test different ATR periods (10-20)
   - Adjust VIX lookback (7-14 days)
   - Experiment with 1.5x-3x ATR stops

This strategy capitalizes on the early stages of volatility expansion while the broader market sentiment remains relatively calm, creating high-probability momentum opportunities with clearly defined risk parameters.
