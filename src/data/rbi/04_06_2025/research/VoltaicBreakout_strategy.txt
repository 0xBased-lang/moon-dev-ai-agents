STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction detection with volume-confirmed breakouts and trend validation for high-probability trades. The core approach identifies periods of compressed volatility followed by explosive moves with strong trend confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Contraction: Uses Bollinger Bandwidth crossing below a historical percentile (typically 20th percentile) to identify tight consolidation periods
2. Volume Surge: Requires normalized volume (current volume/20-day average) > 1.5 to confirm breakout participation
3. Trend Validation: ADX must rise above 25 within 3 bars of breakout to confirm sustainable trend

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Bollinger Bandwidth crosses below historical 20th percentile
2. Confirmation 1: Normalized volume > 1.5 on breakout bar
3. Confirmation 2: ADX > 25 within 3 bars of breakout
4. Entry: Buy/sell stop at high/low of breakout bar

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: 
   - 1st target: 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry
   - 2nd target: Close when ADX begins declining from peak
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Initial: 0.75x ATR from entry
   - Trailing: Move to breakeven when price reaches 1x ATR profit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit: 5% of account
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Filter: Only trade when VIX is above 15 (ensures adequate volatility)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) for Bandwidth calculation
2. Volume 20-day moving average for normalization
3. ADX (14-period) for trend strength
4. ATR (14-period) for risk measurement
5. Historical percentile calculator for Bandwidth

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different historical percentiles (15th-25th) for Bandwidth threshold
2. Experiment with ADX thresholds (20-30) for different instruments
3. Adjust volume multiplier based on asset liquidity
4. Consider adding RSI filter (40-60 range at breakout) for additional confirmation

This strategy works best on liquid assets with strong trending characteristics (major forex pairs, large-cap stocks, commodities) during active trading hours. The VoltaicBreakout name reflects the strategy's focus on capturing electrical-like energy releases from compressed volatility states.
