STRATEGY_NAME: CloudStochSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This multi-timeframe strategy combines Heikin-Ashi trend confirmation with Ichimoku Cloud support and stochastic RSI momentum, creating a synchronized entry system with divergence-based exits.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi (4H): Filters for clean trend direction
2. Ichimoku Cloud (4H): Identifies key support/resistance
3. Stochastic RSI (1H): Measures momentum extremes
4. MACD Histogram (15M): Detects exit divergence patterns

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 4-hour Heikin-Ashi candle must close ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud
2. Confirmation: 1-hour Stochastic RSI (14,3,3) must cross above 20 level
3. Volume: Preferably above 20-period average (recommended but not required)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: Price closes back INSIDE the Ichimoku Cloud on 4H
2. Early Exit: Bearish MACD histogram divergence appears on 15M chart
   - When price makes higher high but MACD histogram shows lower high
3. Emergency Exit: Heikin-Ashi candle color change to red (optional filter)

Risk Management:
1. Stop Placement: Below most recent swing low (for longs)
2. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% per trade
3. Time Filter: Avoid trading during major news events
4. Correlation: Don't take same-direction trades in correlated pairs

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (4H)
2. Ichimoku Cloud (4H - standard 9/26/52 settings)
3. Stochastic RSI (1H - 14,3,3 settings)
4. MACD histogram (15M - standard 12/26/9 settings)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different Stochastic RSI levels (15-25) for cross threshold
- Experiment with Cloud penetration requirements (full candle vs wick)
- Consider adding ADX >25 filter for stronger trends

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce whipsaws during ranging conditions. The multi-timeframe approach provides high-probability entries while the divergence exit helps capture maximum trend movement.
