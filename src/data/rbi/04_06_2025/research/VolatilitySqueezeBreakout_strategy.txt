STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Percentile (<10):** Measures volatility contraction, indicating a potential breakout when the bandwidth is in the lowest 10% of its historical range.  
2. **Volume Oscillator Spike (>2 Std Dev):** Confirms breakout potential with unusually high volume, signaling strong participation.  
3. **Breakout Direction Entry:** Enters in the direction of the breakout from the volatility squeeze.  
4. **Swing Extreme Stop-Loss:** Places stop-loss at the prior swing high/low to manage risk.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for Bollinger Bandwidth to drop below the 10th percentile (indicating extreme volatility contraction).  
2. Confirm with a volume oscillator spike exceeding 2 standard deviations above its mean.  
3. Enter long on a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band or short on a breakout below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take-Profit:** Use a trailing stop or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place stop-loss at the most recent swing low (for long) or swing high (for short).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on stop-loss distance (e.g., risking 1-2% of capital per trade).  
2. Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 Std Dev) + Bandwidth calculation.  
2. Volume Oscillator (e.g., Volume MA or OBV with Std Dev bands).  
3. Historical percentile ranking for Bandwidth.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation.  
- Avoid using in choppy or range-bound conditions unless confirmed by volume.  
- Backtest to optimize percentile thresholds and volume deviation settings.
