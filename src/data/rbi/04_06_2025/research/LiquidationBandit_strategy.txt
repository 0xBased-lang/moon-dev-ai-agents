STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band breakouts with funding rate analysis and liquidation zone targeting for high-probability mean reversion trades in crypto markets.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Breakout (20-period, 2 std dev)
2. Negative Funding Rate Spike (indicates excessive short positioning)
3. Open Interest Clusters (identifies potential liquidation zones)
4. ATR-Based Volatility Contraction (exit signal)
5. Volume Confirmation (validates exits)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: Price breaks ABOVE upper Bollinger Band
2. Confirmation: Simultaneous spike in negative funding rates (minimum 0.01% daily)
3. Target Zone: Nearest high open interest cluster above current price (liquidation magnet)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: When price approaches identified open interest cluster
2. Stop Loss: 1.5x ATR(14) below entry point
3. Emergency Exit: Volume drops below 20-period average while volatility contracts (ATR drops below 50% of entry value)

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum Daily Trades: 3 (to avoid overexposure during volatile periods)
3. Time Filter: Only trade during high liquidity hours (UTC 12:00-16:00)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Funding Rate data feed
3. Open Interest heatmap
4. ATR (14 periods)
5. Volume MA (20 periods)

Unique Aspects:
- Exploits the "short squeeze" setup when overleveraged shorts face liquidations
- Uses open interest clusters as natural profit targets
- Combines volatility expansion (entry) with contraction (exit) signals
- Requires alignment of technical breakout with derivatives market conditions

Optimization Tips:
1. Adjust Bollinger Band period (18-22) based on asset volatility
2. Fine-tune funding rate threshold per asset (more volatile assets may require higher thresholds)
3. Validate open interest clusters with volume profile analysis
4. Test ATR multiplier (1.3x-1.7x) for optimal stop placement

This strategy works best in crypto markets with:
- High leverage availability
- Liquid perpetual futures markets
- Clear open interest data availability
- Volatile but trending conditions
