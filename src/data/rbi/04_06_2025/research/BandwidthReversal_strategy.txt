STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with RSI oversold conditions to identify potential reversal opportunities in low-volatility environments.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - Measures volatility contraction
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) - Identifies oversold conditions
3. Dynamic exit mechanism based on volatility expansion

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band Width must reach a 20-day low (indicating extreme contraction)
2. Confirmation: RSI must cross above 30 from below (shifting momentum)
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously for valid entry

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 5% gain from entry price (fixed take-profit)
2. Stop Condition: Exit when BBW exceeds its 10-day average (volatility expansion)
3. Whichever condition triggers first determines the exit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should account for the 5% target (risk 1-2% of capital per trade)
2. Consider adding a stop-loss at 2-3% below entry as additional protection
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false signals

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations recommended)
2. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) calculation
3. RSI (14-period standard setting)
4. 10-day simple moving average of BBW

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different RSI thresholds (25-35) for various instruments
2. Experiment with BBW lookback periods (15-25 days)
3. Adjust profit targets based on asset volatility (3-7% range)
4. Consider time-based exits (e.g., 5 days) if price stagnates

This strategy works best in ranging markets and may produce false signals during strong trends. It's particularly effective in mean-reverting assets and should be avoided in strongly trending instruments without additional confirmation.
