STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility breakout signals with volume confirmation for mean-reversion trades, focusing on oversold conditions with strong volume participation.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Bands: Uses 30-day volatility bands (likely Bollinger Bands or Keltner Channels) to identify extreme price levels
2. Volume Surge Filter: Requires trading volume >2x the average volume as confirmation
3. RSI Mean Reversion: Uses RSI crossing 50 as exit signal for profit-taking

Entry Rules:
1. Price must breach the lower volatility band (indicating oversold condition)
2. Volume must surge to at least 2x the average volume (confirming strong participation)
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously to trigger a long entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When RSI crosses back above 50 level (signaling mean reversion complete)
2. Optional Stop-Loss: Could be placed below recent swing low or volatility band extreme

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should account for the volatility band width
2. Stop-loss placement should consider the strategy's mean-reversion nature
3. Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events

Required Indicators:
1. 30-day volatility bands (Bollinger Bands or Keltner Channels recommended)
2. Volume indicator with 30-day average calculation
3. 14-period RSI (or customizable period)

Optimization Notes:
1. Volatility band period (30 days) could be tested for different market conditions
2. Volume multiplier (2x) could be adjusted based on asset liquidity
3. RSI period could be optimized for different timeframes

This strategy works best in ranging markets with clear mean-reversion tendencies, and may underperform in strong trending markets. The volume surge requirement helps filter out false breakdowns.
