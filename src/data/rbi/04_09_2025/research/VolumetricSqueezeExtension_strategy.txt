STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueezeExtension

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-confirmed momentum with volatility contraction patterns and Fibonacci-based profit targets for high-probability trades.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted MACD (VW-MACD) - Modifies traditional MACD by incorporating trading volume into its calculations
2. Bollinger Band Squeeze - Identifies periods of low volatility that often precede significant price movements
3. Dynamic Fibonacci Extensions - Uses recent swing points to calculate profit targets that adapt to current market conditions

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract to a predefined squeeze threshold (typically when bandwidth is below 20% of its 20-period average)
2. Confirm a VW-MACD crossover (either bullish or bearish) with volume at least 20% above the 50-period average
3. Enter long when:
   - Price is above the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
   - Bullish VW-MACD crossover occurs (signal line crosses above MACD line)
4. Enter short when:
   - Price is below the middle Bollinger Band
   - Bearish VW-MACD crossover occurs (signal line crosses below MACD line)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - Calculate Fibonacci extensions (38.2%, 61.8%, 100%) from the most recent significant swing low to swing high for long positions
   - Use swing high to swing low for short positions
   - Scale out of positions at each Fibonacci level (e.g., 50% at 38.2%, 30% at 61.8%, 20% at 100%)
2. Stop Loss:
   - Place initial stop at the opposite Bollinger Band (lower band for longs, upper band for shorts)
   - Trail stop to breakeven when price reaches the first Fibonacci target (38.2%)

Risk Management:
1. Position size should not exceed 2% of account capital per trade
2. Maximum portfolio exposure limited to 10% across all positions
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events that may cause abnormal volatility
4. Daily loss limit of 5% of account value

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted MACD (12,26,9 periods with volume multiplier)
2. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
3. Bollinger Band Width indicator (to measure squeeze conditions)
4. Fibonacci Extension tool (for dynamic target calculation)
5. Volume indicator (50-period moving average)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust squeeze threshold based on asset volatility (lower for more volatile assets)
- Test different Fibonacci extension levels for optimal profit-taking
- Consider adding a time-based exit (e.g., close after 3 bars if targets aren't hit)
- Validate strategy across multiple timeframes (15min-4hr works best)
