STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaBand Convergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines volume-weighted price action with volatility contraction
- Uses Bollinger Bandwidth contraction as a volatility filter
- Requires volume confirmation through delta volume spikes
- Focuses on high-probability breakout scenarios

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for 50-period VWAP to converge with price (price within 0.5% of VWAP)
- Bollinger Bandwidth must be narrowing (20-period BB width decreasing for 3 consecutive periods)
- Delta volume must spike to at least 2x the 10-day median delta volume
- Enter long on breakout above upper Bollinger Band or short below lower band

3. Exit Rules:
- Take profit at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width from entry point
- Stop loss placed at opposite Bollinger Band
- Exit if delta volume drops below 0.5x the 10-day median for 2 consecutive periods
- Close position if Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond entry level by 25%

4. Risk Management:
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
- Avoid trading during first/last 30 minutes of session

5. Required Indicators:
- 50-period Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
- 20-period Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations)
- Bollinger Bandwidth (BB width) indicator
- Delta volume (buy volume - sell volume)
- 10-day median delta volume reference line

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- Works well in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Requires monitoring of volume dynamics throughout trade
- Most effective on 15m-1h timeframes for day trading
