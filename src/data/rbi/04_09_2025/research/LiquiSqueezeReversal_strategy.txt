STRATEGY_NAME: LiquiSqueezeReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze (1-hour timeframe):** Identifies periods of low volatility where price is consolidating, often preceding a breakout or reversal.  
2. **Liquidation Heatmap Density Surge:** Tracks clusters of liquidations (stop hunts) to pinpoint high-probability reversal zones.  
3. **Price Rejection Candles:** Pin bars, engulfing patterns, or wicks at key liquidation levels confirm entry signals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for a Bollinger Band squeeze (bands narrowing significantly) on the 1-hour chart.  
2. Monitor liquidation heatmap for a sudden spike in density near the squeeze zone.  
3. Enter short/long on a rejection candle (e.g., long wick, bearish/bullish engulfing) at the heatmap’s liquidation cluster:  
   - **Short:** Rejection candle forms near a high-density liquidation level above price.  
   - **Long:** Rejection candle forms near a high-density liquidation level below price.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:** Target the opposite Bollinger Band or a 1:2 risk-reward ratio.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place beyond the rejection candle’s extreme (e.g., above the wick for shorts, below for longs).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Risk ≤1-2% per trade.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false squeezes.  
- Confirm heatmap alignment with higher-timeframe support/resistance.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 default settings).  
2. Liquidation heatmap tool (e.g., Coinalyze, Hyblock).  
3. Candlestick patterns for rejection confirmation.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or mildly trending markets.  
- Combine with RSI (oversold/overbought) for additional confluence.  
- Backtest heatmap thresholds (e.g., "surge" = top 10% of recent density).
