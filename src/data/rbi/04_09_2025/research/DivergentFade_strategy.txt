STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentFade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentFade strategy is a mean-reversion approach that capitalizes on overextended price movements when confirmed by volume and momentum divergences. This strategy combines Bollinger Bands, volume analysis, MACD histogram, and ATR for a comprehensive fade setup.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies potential overbought/oversold conditions
2. Volume - Confirms weakening momentum when price breaches bands
3. MACD Histogram (12,26,9) - Detects momentum divergence
4. ATR (14) - Used for dynamic stop placement

Entry Rules (Short Setup):
1. Price breaches upper Bollinger Band
2. Volume is declining during the breach (at least 2 consecutive lower volume bars)
3. MACD histogram shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high while histogram makes lower high)
4. Enter short on next candle open

Entry Rules (Long Setup):
1. Price breaches lower Bollinger Band
2. Volume is declining during the breach (at least 2 consecutive lower volume bars)
3. MACD histogram shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low while histogram makes higher low)
4. Enter long on next candle open

Exit Rules:
1. Stop Loss: 1.5x ATR from entry price (opposite side of trade)
2. Take Profit: 
   - Primary: When price returns to middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA)
   - Secondary: When opposite divergence signal appears

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss is mandatory on all positions
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (requires strategy review)

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 period, 2 standard deviations
- Volume: 14 period SMA for reference
- MACD: 12,26,9 standard settings
- ATR: 14 period

Additional Notes:
1. Works best in ranging or mildly trending markets
2. Avoid during strong trending markets (confirmed by ADX > 30)
3. Higher timeframe signals (4H/Daily) tend to be more reliable
4. Requires patience - not all Bollinger Band breaches will qualify

This strategy combines multiple confirmation factors to identify high-probability fade opportunities while maintaining strict risk control through ATR-based stops. The unique combination of volume confirmation with MACD divergence creates a robust filter against false signals.
