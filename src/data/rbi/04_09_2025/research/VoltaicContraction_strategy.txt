STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy specializes in trading volatility contractions by combining Bollinger Band compression with futures basis spread divergence, confirmed by high-volume breakouts.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width (BBW) - Measures volatility contraction when below threshold
2. Futures Basis Spread - Tracks divergence between spot and futures prices
3. Volume Surge - Requires breakout confirmation via 90th percentile volume spike
4. Breakout Direction - Trade in direction of the breakout confirmed by volume

Entry Rules:
1. BBW must be below 0.5 (indicating volatility contraction)
2. Futures basis spread must show divergence from price action
3. Price must break out of contraction range
4. Volume must surge above 90th percentile of recent volume (20-period lookback)
5. All conditions must align within same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Take-profit at 2:1 reward-risk ratio from entry
2. Stop-loss placed at opposite side of contraction range
3. Time-based exit after 5 candles if target not hit
4. Early exit if BBW expands beyond 1.5 (volatility expansion)

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No pyramiding positions
4. Stop-loss must be placed immediately after entry
5. Avoid trading during major economic news events

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) for BBW calculation
2. Volume indicator with percentile calculation
3. Futures basis spread indicator
4. Price chart with clear contraction range identification

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust BBW threshold based on asset volatility (0.3-0.7 range)
2. Test different volume percentile thresholds (85th-95th)
3. Verify basis spread divergence patterns historically
4. Backtest contraction ranges across different timeframes

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive potential of volatility contractions when combined with futures market divergence and high-conviction volume confirmations, creating a high-probability trading approach.
