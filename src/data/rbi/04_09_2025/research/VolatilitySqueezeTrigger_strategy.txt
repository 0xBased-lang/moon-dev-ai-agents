STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySqueezeTrigger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three key technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, Volume, and MACD) with Keltner Channels to identify high-probability entries during low volatility periods and exits when volatility expands.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies volatility contraction (squeeze)
2. Volume (50-period MA) - Confirms breakout validity
3. MACD (12,26,9) - Provides momentum confirmation
4. Keltner Channels (20,2) - Defines exit points

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width must be below its 20-period average (volatility squeeze)
2. Confirmation 1: Volume must spike above its 50-period MA
3. Confirmation 2: MACD must show bullish crossover (for long) or bearish crossover (for short)
4. Entry: Buy when all three conditions align in the same direction

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: When price touches the opposite Keltner Channel (upper for long, lower for short)
2. Stop Loss: When price breaches the same-side Keltner Channel (lower for long, upper for short)
3. Alternative Exit: MACD shows reversal signal in profit zone

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop placement: 1.5x the Bollinger Band width at entry
3. Maximum daily trades: 3 to avoid over-trading low volatility periods

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume with 50-period MA
3. MACD (12,26,9)
4. Keltner Channels (20,2)

Special Notes:
- Works best in ranging markets
- Avoid during high volatility/news events
- Requires confirmation from all three indicators to filter false breakouts
- Ideal timeframe: 1H-4H charts for swing trades
