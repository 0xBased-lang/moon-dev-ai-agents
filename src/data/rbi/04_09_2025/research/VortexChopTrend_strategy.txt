STRATEGY_NAME: VortexChopTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the Vortex Indicator (VI) with the Choppiness Index (CI) to identify emerging trends in non-choppy market conditions. The approach focuses on catching early trend movements while avoiding sideways markets.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI): 
   - VI+ (positive trend movement)
   - VI- (negative trend movement)
   - Crossover signals potential trend changes

2. Choppiness Index (CI):
   - Measures market consolidation (0-100 scale)
   - Below 38.6 indicates trending conditions
   - Above 61 indicates choppy/range-bound markets

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish signal)
2. Confirmation: CI must be below 38.6 (confirming trending environment)
3. Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: CI rises above 61 (market becoming choppy)
2. Optional Exit: VI- crosses above VI+ (trend reversal signal)
3. Whichever condition occurs first triggers the exit

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3% below entry)
   - OR below recent swing low (for longs)
3. Take Profit: 
   - 2:1 risk-reward ratio minimum
   - OR trail stop when CI approaches 50

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (standard 14-period)
2. Choppiness Index (14-period recommended)
3. Optional: Volume confirmation (increasing volume on entry)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1H-4H timeframes in trending markets
- Works well on forex majors and liquid commodities
- Avoid using during major news events
- Combine with price action confirmation for better accuracy
- Backtest optimal CI thresholds for specific instruments (38.6-61 range may vary)

This strategy excels in capturing early trend movements while avoiding false signals in ranging markets, making it particularly effective in trending environments with clear directional bias.
