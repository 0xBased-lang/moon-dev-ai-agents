STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilitySurgeReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on extreme market conditions by identifying oversold situations with unusual volume and open interest activity, then riding the potential reversal with tight risk controls.

Key Components:
1. Extreme Price Drop: 3-standard deviation move (statistically significant outlier)
2. Volume Surge: 50% increase in trading volume (confirms panic selling)
3. Open Interest Decline: Shows short covering/long liquidation (potential exhaustion)
4. RSI Confirmation: 5-minute RSI crossing 50 (momentum shift confirmation)
5. ATR-based Trailing Stop: 2x ATR protects profits while allowing room for recovery

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger Condition: Simultaneous occurrence of:
   - Price drops 3 standard deviations from mean
   - Volume increases ≥50% from 20-period average
   - Open interest decreases
2. Entry Execution: Market order at next available price after conditions met

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When 5-minute RSI crosses above 50 (momentum confirmation)
2. Protective Exit: Trailing stop at 2x 14-period ATR from highest point since entry
3. Emergency Exit: If price makes new low after entry (failed reversal)

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Maximum 2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Initial stop at entry price minus 1x ATR (if not using trailing stop immediately)
3. Time Filter: Avoid trading first/last 30 minutes of session
4. Session Filter: Only trade during high liquidity hours (e.g., 9:30am-3:30pm EST)

Required Indicators:
1. Standard Deviation (20-period)
2. Volume (20-period average as baseline)
3. Open Interest (futures/options markets)
4. RSI (5-minute, 14-period)
5. ATR (14-period)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different standard deviation thresholds (2.5-3.5σ)
- Experiment with volume surge percentages (40-60%)
- Adjust RSI timeframe (3-10 minutes)
- Vary ATR multiplier (1.5-2.5x)

This strategy works best in:
- Futures markets with good liquidity
- During earnings seasons or news events
- In markets prone to overreactions
- When VIX is elevated (>20)
