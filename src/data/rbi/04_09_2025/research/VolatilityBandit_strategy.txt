STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBandit

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify high-probability volatility breakouts with volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier)
3. Volume filter (20% above 20-period average)
4. Price closing outside both bands as trigger

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to close completely outside both Bollinger Bands AND Keltner Channels
2. Confirm volume is at least 20% above 20-period average volume
3. Enter long if above upper bands, short if below lower bands
4. Only take first breakout signal per direction

Exit Rules:
1. Close position when price closes back inside either channel
2. Optional trailing stop at opposite band (e.g., for longs, trail at lower Bollinger Band)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on distance between entry and opposite band
2. Maximum risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of capital)
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Consider time-based exits if no reversal occurs (e.g., 5-10 periods)

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 periods, 2 std dev
- Keltner Channels: 20 periods, 1.5 ATR multiplier
- Volume: 20-period simple moving average

Optimization Tips:
1. Test different period lengths (14-30)
2. Adjust standard deviation (1.8-2.2)
3. Vary ATR multiplier (1.3-1.8)
4. Test volume thresholds (15-25%)

Special Notes:
- Works best in trending markets
- May generate false signals in ranging markets
- Combine with trend filter (e.g., 50/200 EMA) for better results
- Most effective on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trading
