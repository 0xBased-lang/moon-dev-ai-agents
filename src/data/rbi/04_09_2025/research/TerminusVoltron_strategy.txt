STRATEGY_NAME: TerminusVoltron

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- VIX Term Structure Analysis: Monitors the relationship between front-month and second-month VIX futures to identify backwardation (front month > second month) vs. contango (front month < second month)
- ADX Trend Strength: Uses Average Directional Index (ADX) to measure overall trend strength, with special attention to rising ADX values
- Volatility Positioning: Specifically targets long volatility exposure during favorable conditions

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: VIX term structure must be in backwardation (front-month VIX future > second-month VIX future)
- Confirmation: ADX(14) must be rising and above 25, indicating strengthening trend momentum
- Execution: Enter long volatility position (via VIX futures, VIX-related ETFs, or volatility derivatives) when both conditions are met

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: VIX term structure flips to contango (front-month VIX future < second-month VIX future)
- Secondary Exit: ADX(14) begins declining significantly (e.g., drops >5 points from peak)
- Emergency Exit: If VIX spikes >30% against position without term structure confirmation

4. Risk Management:
- Position Sizing: Limit volatility positions to 5-10% of total portfolio due to high-risk nature
- Stop Loss: Implement 15-20% trailing stop on volatility positions
- Correlation Check: Avoid overlapping volatility positions with other portfolio holdings

5. Required Indicators:
- VIX Futures Term Structure (front-month vs. second-month prices)
- ADX(14) with +DI/-DI components
- Optional: Volume confirmation for VIX-related instruments

6. Special Considerations:
- Best applied during periods of market stress or uncertainty
- Requires daily monitoring of VIX futures term structure
- Most effective when combined with broader market trend analysis
- Performance tends to be cyclical - works best during volatility regime shifts

7. Optimization Notes:
- ADX period can be adjusted between 10-20 days based on backtesting
- May add filter requiring backwardation to persist for 2-3 days before entry
- Can incorporate VIX spot vs. futures premium as additional confirmation

This strategy capitalizes on the predictive power of VIX term structure combined with trend confirmation, creating a systematic approach to volatility trading that avoids emotional decision-making during market turbulence.
