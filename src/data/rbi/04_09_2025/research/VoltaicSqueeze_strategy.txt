STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Compression Detection:**  
   - Narrowing Bollinger Bands® width (20-period, 2 standard deviations) indicates decreasing volatility.  
   - Declining Chaikin Volatility (10-period) confirms the compression phase.  

2. **Breakout Confirmation:**  
   - Volume spike exceeding 2x the 20-day average volume signals strong participation in the breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Long Entry:**  
   - Bollinger Bands width must be in the lowest 20% of its 50-day range (extreme compression).  
   - Chaikin Volatility must show a downtrend (lower highs/lows over 5+ periods).  
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band *and* volume surges ≥2x 20-day average.  

2. **Short Entry:**  
   - Same compression criteria as above.  
   - Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with ≥2x volume spike.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit-Taking:**  
   - Close 50% at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width at entry.  
   - Trail remaining position with a 3-period ATR (14) stop.  

2. **Stop-Loss:**  
   - Fixed: 1x the Bollinger Band width at entry (volatility-adjusted).  
   - Emergency: Close if Chaikin Volatility spikes upward (reversal signal).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Max 2% capital per trade.  
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (cool-off period).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands® (20, 2) + Width.  
2. Chaikin Volatility (10).  
3. Volume (20-day MA + spike detector).  
4. ATR (14) for trailing stop.  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines *price* (Bollinger), *momentum* (Chaikin), and *volume* filters to avoid false breakouts.  
- Targets "coiled spring" setups where volatility contraction precedes explosive moves.  

**Note:** Works best on 1H-4H timeframes for swing trades in FX/commodities. Backtest optimal Bollinger % thresholds per asset.
