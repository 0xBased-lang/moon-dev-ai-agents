STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricHullSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three powerful technical elements - Hull Moving Average smoothing, volume-weighted volatility compression, and on-chain reserve analysis - to identify high-probability breakout opportunities with built-in confirmation filters.

Key Components:
1. Hull Moving Average (10-day): Provides smoother trend identification than traditional MAs with reduced lag
2. Volume-Weighted Volatility Squeeze (3-day): Measures compression of price range relative to trading volume
3. On-Chain Exchange Reserves: Monitors divergence in exchange balances as confirmation signal
4. Range Expansion Multiplier (2x): Defines profit-taking based on volatility expansion

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 10-day HMA flattens (slope < 15 degrees) indicating consolidation
2. Confirmation: 3-day volume-weighted Bollinger Band width contracts below 0.5 standard deviations
3. Trigger: Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band with volume > 20-day average

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Target: 2x the average true range (ATR) of past 14 days from entry point
2. Stop Loss: Trailing stop at 1.5x ATR below highest high since entry
3. Emergency Exit: On-chain exchange reserves show >5% divergence from 7-day trend

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum drawdown: 5% per trade, 15% across all positions
3. Time stop: Exit after 5 days if no target hit
4. Blackout period: No new entries within 3 days of previous exit

Required Indicators:
1. Hull Moving Average (10-period)
2. Volume-Weighted Bollinger Bands (20,2)
3. Average True Range (14-period)
4. On-chain exchange reserve tracking
5. Volume oscillator (current vs 20-day MA)

Unique Advantages:
- Combines technical compression with on-chain confirmation
- Uses HMA for cleaner trend signals than SMA/EMA
- Volume-weighting prevents false breakouts
- Dual exit criteria (technical + on-chain) improves win rate

Optimization Notes:
- Test HMA periods between 8-12 days
- Adjust volatility squeeze threshold (0.4-0.6 std dev)
- Calibrate range multiplier (1.8x-2.2x) to market conditions
- Verify reserve divergence threshold with exchange-specific data
