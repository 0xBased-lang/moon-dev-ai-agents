STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility contraction with explosive breakout signals, using a multi-indicator confirmation system for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Filter: Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2) in lowest 10th percentile indicates extreme contraction
2. Channel Confirmation: Keltner Channel (20,1.5) provides secondary volatility reference
3. Volume Surge: 2x 20-period average volume confirms breakout validity

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Bollinger Bandwidth(20,2) < 10th percentile (extreme squeeze)
2. Price closes ABOVE upper Bollinger Band
3. Volume exceeds 2x 20-period average
4. Keltner Channel trending upward (optional confirmation)

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Bollinger Bandwidth(20,2) < 10th percentile 
2. Price closes BELOW lower Bollinger Band  
3. Volume exceeds 2x 20-period average
4. Keltner Channel trending downward (optional confirmation)

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing stop: Close beyond opposite Bollinger Band
2. Time-based: Exit after 5 bars if no continuation
3. Profit target: 2x recent Average True Range (14)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop: Opposite Bollinger Band or 1.5x ATR
3. Maximum daily loss limit: 5% of account

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + Bandwidth calculation
2. Keltner Channel (20,1.5)
3. Volume average (20 period)
4. ATR (14) for risk sizing

Optimization Notes:
- Test different percentile thresholds (5-15%)
- Adjust volume multiplier (1.5x-3x)
- Experiment with channel periods (14-30)

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive moves following periods of extreme volatility compression, with volume confirmation reducing false breakouts. The multi-indicator approach provides layered confirmation for higher probability trades.
