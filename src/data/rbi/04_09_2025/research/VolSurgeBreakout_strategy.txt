STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurge Breakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Adjusted VWAP**: Uses a modified Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) that adjusts for recent volatility, providing a dynamic support/resistance level.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation**: Requires a significant spike in trading volume (e.g., 1.5x the 20-period average) to validate breakout signals.  
3. **Bollinger Band Contraction Exit**: Monitors Bollinger Band width contraction below a dynamic threshold (e.g., 50% of its 10-period range) to signal loss of momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Breakout Signal**: Enter long when price closes above the volatility-adjusted VWAP.  
2. **Volume Confirmation**: The breakout must coincide with a volume surge (e.g., volume > 1.5x 20-period average).  
3. **Filter**: Optional—require the breakout candle to be larger than the average true range (ATR) of the last 5 candles.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Contraction**: Exit when the Bollinger Band width (upper band - lower band) contracts below a dynamic threshold (e.g., 50% of its 10-period range).  
2. **Trailing Stop**: Optional—use a trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR) to protect profits during strong trends.  
3. **Time-Based Exit**: Close the trade after a fixed period (e.g., 5 bars) if no exit signal occurs.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: Place initial stop-loss below the recent swing low or at 1.5x ATR below entry.  
2. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
3. **Volatility Filter**: Avoid trading during extremely low volatility (e.g., Bollinger Band width < 30% of its 10-period range).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Volatility-Adjusted VWAP**: Custom VWAP incorporating ATR or standard deviation.  
2. **Volume Surge Detector**: Volume compared to a moving average (e.g., 20-period SMA).  
3. **Bollinger Bands**: Standard settings (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations) with width monitoring.  
4. **Optional**: ATR for stop-loss and candle size filtering.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility-sensitive VWAP with volume confirmation for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses Bollinger Band contraction (a mean-reversion signal) as a trend-exit trigger, creating a hybrid trend-following/mean-reversion approach.  
- Dynamic thresholds adapt to changing market conditions.  

**Best Suited For:**  
- Intraday or swing trading in trending markets with clear volatility cycles.  
- Assets with consistent volume patterns (e.g., equities, active forex pairs).
