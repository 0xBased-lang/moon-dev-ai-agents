STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band squeeze detection with On-Balance Volume (OBV) confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities with strong volume backing. The approach focuses on periods of low volatility followed by expansion, filtered by volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies squeeze conditions when bands contract
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) - Confirms breakout with volume momentum
3. Trailing Stop (5%) - Manages risk on open positions

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band squeeze condition (upper and lower bands within 10% of each other)
2. Price must close outside the Bollinger Bands (upper for long, lower for short)
3. OBV must be at a 10-day high (confirms volume participation)
4. All three conditions must align for entry

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit: 5% trailing stop from entry price
2. Secondary exit: If OBV drops below its 5-day moving average
3. Emergency exit: If price re-enters the Bollinger Bands

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss activated immediately after entry
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV)
3. 5-day MA of OBV (for exit confirmation)

Optimization Notes:
- Backtest different squeeze thresholds (8-12%)
- Test alternative OBV lookback periods (7-14 days)
- Experiment with trailing stop percentages (3-7%)

This strategy excels in trending markets after periods of consolidation, using volume confirmation to filter false breakouts. The combination of volatility contraction/expansion with volume momentum creates a robust trading edge.
