STRATEGY_NAME: FundingBandExtreme  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Counter-Trend Focus:** The strategy aims to capitalize on overextended price movements by taking positions opposite to the prevailing trend when specific conditions are met.  
2. **Funding Rate Extremes:** Uses funding rate data to identify periods of excessive leverage or sentiment extremes, which often precede reversals.  
3. **Bollinger Band Extremes:** Price approaching the upper or lower Bollinger Band (typically 2 standard deviations) signals potential overbought/oversold conditions.  
4. **Volatility Contraction:** Exits trades when Bollinger Bands contract, indicating reduced momentum and potential trend exhaustion.  
5. **Funding Rate Normalization:** Monitors funding rates returning to neutral levels as a signal to exit.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Price touches or exceeds the upper Bollinger Band.  
  - Funding rate is significantly positive (indicating excessive long leverage).  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  - Price touches or falls below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  - Funding rate is significantly negative (indicating excessive short leverage).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Volatility Contraction:** Exit when the Bollinger Band width (distance between upper and lower bands) narrows by a predefined percentage (e.g., 20% from entry width).  
- **Funding Rate Normalization:** Exit when the funding rate moves back within a neutral range (e.g., Â±0.005% for perpetual contracts).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Optional stop-loss at the opposite Bollinger Band extreme or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) beyond the entry point.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the high volatility inherent in counter-trend trades (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Avoid entering during major news events or periods of erratic funding rate fluctuations.  
- Consider a maximum daily or weekly loss limit to prevent overexposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. **Funding Rate Data** (real-time or historical from the exchange).  
3. **Bollinger Band Width** (to measure volatility contraction).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging or mean-reverting markets; may underperform in strong trending conditions.  
- Ideal for crypto perpetual futures markets where funding rates are a key sentiment indicator.  
- Backtest for optimal thresholds for "extreme" funding rates and Bollinger Band interactions.
