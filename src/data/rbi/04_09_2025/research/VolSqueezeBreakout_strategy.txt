STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction with volume surge confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The unique combination of volatility compression and volume expansion creates a powerful setup for explosive price movements.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures the 20-period BB width reaching a 6-month low, indicating extreme volatility compression
2. Volume Surge Filter: Requires volume exceeding 1.5x the 30-day average for confirmation
3. Trailing Exit: Uses a dynamic 2x ATR stop to capture trends while protecting profits

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 20-period Bollinger Band width to reach its lowest point in the past 6 months (126 trading days)
2. Confirm with volume exceeding 150% of the 30-day average volume
3. Enter on the first candle that closes outside either Bollinger Band (upper or lower) with the volume confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Initial Stop: Set at 2x ATR(14) from entry price in the opposite direction of the trade
2. Trailing Stop: Adjust stop daily to maintain 2x ATR(14) distance from the most extreme favorable price
3. Optional Profit Target: Consider taking partial profits at 3x ATR(14) if desired

Risk Management:
1. Position size should be calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Avoid trading during major economic news events that may cause false breakouts
3. Wait for full candle closes outside Bollinger Bands to confirm the breakout

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator
3. Volume indicator with 30-day average
4. ATR(14) for stop calculation

Additional Notes:
- Works best on liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- More reliable on daily timeframe but can be adapted to 4H with adjustments
- Combine with sector/overall market direction for higher probability trades
- Backtest suggests best results when trading with the prevailing higher timeframe trend
