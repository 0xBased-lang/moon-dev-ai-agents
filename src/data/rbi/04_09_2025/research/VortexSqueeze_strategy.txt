STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI)**: Used to confirm trend direction by comparing VI+ (positive trend) and VI- (negative trend) lines.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width (BB Width)**: Measures volatility contraction (squeeze) and expansion.  
3. **Historical Threshold**: A predefined level of BB Width expansion used to signal exits.  

**Entry Rules (Long Position):**  
- **VI+ Crosses Above VI-**: Signals a potential bullish trend.  
- **Low Volatility Condition**: BB Width must be below a certain percentile (e.g., 20th percentile of its historical range), indicating a volatility squeeze.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **BB Width Expansion**: Exit when BB Width expands above a historical threshold (e.g., 80th percentile), signaling increased volatility and potential trend exhaustion.  
- **VI- Crosses Above VI+**: Optional secondary exit if the Vortex Indicator shows a bearish reversal.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss**: Set below the recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below the entry price.  
2. **Position Sizing**: Adjust based on volatility (e.g., smaller positions during higher volatility).  
3. **Time-Based Exit**: Exit after a fixed number of bars (e.g., 10-15) if no exit signal is triggered.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-)**  
2. **Bollinger Bands (for Band Width calculation)**  
3. **Historical Volatility Percentile (for BB Width thresholds)**  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (Vortex) with volatility contraction (Bollinger Squeeze).  
- Uses dynamic exit thresholds based on historical volatility ranges.  
- Avoids trading during high volatility, focusing on high-probability setups.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different percentile thresholds for BB Width (e.g., 15th/85th).  
- Add a filter like a moving average slope to avoid false breakouts.  
- Experiment with trailing stops based on VI- crosses.  

This strategy is ideal for swing trading in ranging or mildly trending markets where volatility cycles are predictable.
