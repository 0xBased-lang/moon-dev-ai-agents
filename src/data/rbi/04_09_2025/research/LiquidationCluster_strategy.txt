STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationCluster  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Clusters:** Focuses on identifying areas in the order book where large clusters of stop-loss orders or liquidations are likely to occur.  
2. **Order Book Imbalance:** Uses order book depth analysis to detect significant buy/sell pressure imbalances that may trigger liquidations.  
3. **Volatility Contraction:** Measures volatility contraction via Bollinger Band width, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
4. **Liquidation Cascade:** Aims to enter trades just before a liquidation cascade and exit once volatility expands post-cascade.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Order Book Imbalance:** Confirm a strong imbalance in the order book (e.g., large bid/ask stack asymmetry).  
2. **Volatility Contraction:** Bollinger Band width must be at a low point (indicating compressed volatility).  
3. **Liquidation Trigger:** Wait for initial price movement toward the liquidation cluster (e.g., stop hunts or aggressive market orders).  
4. **Entry Execution:** Enter in the direction of the expected liquidation cascade (long if shorts are being liquidated, short if longs are being liquidated).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Volatility Expansion:** Exit when Bollinger Band width expands significantly, indicating the liquidation cascade has played out.  
2. **Price Rejection:** If price sharply reverses after the initial move, exit to avoid being caught in a fakeout.  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** If volatility does not expand within a set period (e.g., 3-5 candles), exit the trade to avoid stagnation.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Place stop-loss beyond the liquidation cluster to avoid being stopped out prematurely.  
2. **Position Sizing:** Use conservative sizing due to the high volatility nature of liquidation events.  
3. **Avoid Overleveraging:** Given the explosive nature of liquidations, excessive leverage can lead to rapid losses.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (Width Measurement)** – To detect volatility contraction/expansion.  
2. **Order Book Depth (L2 Data)** – To identify liquidation clusters and imbalances.  
3. **Volume Profile or Time & Sales** – To confirm aggressive order flow during liquidations.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in high-liquidity markets with frequent liquidation events (e.g., crypto, forex, or futures).  
- Requires real-time order book data for best execution.  
- Backtest on historical liquidation events to refine entry/exit timing.  

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive moves caused by forced liquidations while managing risk through volatility-based exits.
