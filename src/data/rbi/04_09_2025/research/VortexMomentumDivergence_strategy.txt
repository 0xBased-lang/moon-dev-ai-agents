STRATEGY_NAME: VortexMomentumDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines three powerful technical indicators to identify high-probability trade setups with strong momentum confirmation. The approach focuses on catching emerging trends while filtering out false signals through volume confirmation.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-): Identifies trend direction and potential reversals through crossover events
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO): Detects momentum divergences that often precede trend reversals
3. Volume Filter: Requires above-average volume to confirm genuine interest in the price movement
4. ATR Trailing Stop: Uses 2x the 14-period Average True Range for dynamic exit management

Entry Rules (Long Position):
1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish vortex crossover)
2. CMO shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low while CMO makes higher low)
3. Current volume exceeds 20-period simple moving average of volume
4. All conditions must occur within 3 bars of each other

Entry Rules (Short Position):
1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish vortex crossover)
2. CMO shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high while CMO makes lower high)
3. Current volume exceeds 20-period simple moving average of volume
4. All conditions must occur within 3 bars of each other

Exit Rules:
1. Trailing stop set at 2x the 14-period ATR from the highest high (long) or lowest low (short)
2. Immediate exit if opposite vortex crossover occurs (VI+ crosses below VI- for longs or VI- crosses below VI+ for shorts)

Risk Management:
1. Position size should be calculated based on 1-2% risk of capital
2. Initial stop can be set at 1x ATR below entry (long) or above entry (short)
3. No trades should be taken if ATR value suggests stop would be >3% of account risk

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (default 14 periods)
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (default 20 periods)
3. Volume 20-period SMA
4. Average True Range (14 periods)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust CMO period between 14-30 based on market volatility
- Consider testing 1.5x-2.5x ATR multiplier for trailing stop
- Volume filter period can be adjusted between 10-30 periods

This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals during ranging conditions. The combination of vortex crossovers, momentum divergences, and volume confirmation creates a robust filter for high-quality setups.
