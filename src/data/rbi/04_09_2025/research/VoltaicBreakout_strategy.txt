STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines Bollinger Band volatility signals with ADX trend strength confirmation
- Uses a 20-period Bollinger Band (standard deviation 2) as primary breakout trigger
- Requires ADX (14-period) to cross above 25 for trend confirmation
- Implements strict 2:1 risk-reward ratio for exits

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry: When price closes ABOVE upper Bollinger Band AND ADX crosses above 25
- Short Entry: When price closes BELOW lower Bollinger Band AND ADX crosses above 25
- Both conditions must be met simultaneously for valid entry

3. Exit Rules:
- Profit Target: 2x initial risk (measured from entry to stop level)
- Stop Loss: Opposite Bollinger Band (for longs: lower band, for shorts: upper band)
- Time Exit: Close position if ADX falls below 20 (trend weakening)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss automatically set at opposite Bollinger Band
- No entries allowed when ADX is below 20 (choppy market filter)
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions open

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
- ADX (14 periods) with +DI/-DI disabled
- Price chart with closing prices

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1H-4H timeframes on liquid instruments
- Requires clear volatility expansion for optimal performance
- Avoid using during major news events due to potential false breakouts
- Works best in trending markets, may underperform in ranging conditions

This strategy combines volatility expansion signals with trend confirmation, creating a systematic approach to capture strong directional moves while filtering out false breakouts through the ADX requirement. The 2:1 reward ratio ensures positive expectancy over multiple trades.
