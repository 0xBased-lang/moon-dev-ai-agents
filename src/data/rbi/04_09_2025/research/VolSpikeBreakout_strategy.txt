STRATEGY_NAME: VolSpikeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility expansion signals with volume confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The core concept revolves around detecting significant price movements that break through established volatility boundaries while being validated by unusual trading activity.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) - Defines the volatility boundaries
2. Volume percentile analysis (90th percentile of 20-day lookback) - Confirms breakout validity
3. Breakout direction detection - Determines long/short bias

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- Price closes ABOVE the upper Bollinger Band (2 std dev)
- Current volume exceeds 90th percentile of past 20 days volume
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously

SHORT ENTRY:
- Price closes BELOW the lower Bollinger Band (2 std dev)
- Current volume exceeds 90th percentile of past 20 days volume
- Both conditions must occur simultaneously

Exit Rules:
- Fixed take-profit at 1.5x the Bollinger Band width (measured at entry)
- Fixed stop-loss at 0.75x the Bollinger Band width (measured at entry)
- Alternative exit: When price re-enters the Bollinger Band (closes inside)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss is mandatory on all positions
3. No new entries allowed until current position is closed
4. Daily time frame recommended for reduced noise

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume indicator with percentile calculation
3. Band width measurement tool (for TP/SL calculation)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in trending markets
- Avoid ranging/choppy periods
- Most effective on liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
- Recommended timeframes: 4H or Daily charts

Additional Notes:
- The 90th volume percentile acts as a filter to confirm institutional participation
- Bollinger Band width should be monitored - wider bands suggest stronger potential moves
- Consider combining with a trend filter (e.g., 200MA) for additional confirmation in strong trends
