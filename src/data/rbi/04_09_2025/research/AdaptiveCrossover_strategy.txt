STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveCrossover  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines moving average crossovers with ADX-based trend strength filtering to identify potential trend reversals while avoiding overextended markets.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **50-period EMA & 200-period EMA Crossover** - The primary signal generator for trend direction.  
2. **ADX (Average Directional Index)** - Used to filter trades based on trend strength.  

**Entry Rules (Long Positions):**  
- Enter when the **50-period EMA crosses above the 200-period EMA** (Golden Cross).  
- **ADX must be below 20**, indicating a weak or consolidating market (potential early trend formation).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit when **ADX rises above 40**, signaling a strong trend that may be nearing exhaustion.  
- Alternatively, exit if the **50-period EMA crosses back below the 200-period EMA** (Death Cross).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Use a **stop-loss below the recent swing low** (for long positions) to limit downside risk.  
- Position sizing should be adjusted based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
2. **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
3. **ADX (14-period default setting, threshold levels at 20 & 40)**  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in **ranging or early-trending markets** (not strong trends).  
- Avoid trading during **high ADX (>30) conditions** to prevent false signals.  
- Can be adapted for short positions by flipping the crossover logic (50EMA below 200EMA).  

This strategy aims to **capture early trend shifts** while avoiding overbought/oversold conditions, making it a **dynamic trend-following approach with adaptive filtering**.
