STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFilteredEMA  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **EMA Crossover System:** Uses the 50-period EMA and 200-period EMA to identify the primary trend direction.  
2. **Volatility Filter:** Incorporates historical volatility (HV) to ensure trades are only taken in low-volatility environments (HV < 20th percentile).  
3. **Exit Conditions:** Exits trades when volatility spikes (HV > 80th percentile) or the EMA crossover reverses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when the 50-period EMA crosses **above** the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross).  
- **Volatility Confirmation:** The trade is only valid if the current historical volatility (HV) is below its 20th percentile (low-volatility regime).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Exit:** Close the position if HV rises above the 80th percentile (high-volatility regime).  
2. **Trend Reversal Exit:** Exit if the 50-period EMA crosses **below** the 200-period EMA (Death Cross).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Optional—can be set below recent swing lows or using an ATR-based stop.  
- **Position Sizing:** Adjust based on volatility (e.g., larger positions in lower volatility, smaller in higher volatility).  
- **Avoid Overexposure:** Only trade when both the EMA crossover and volatility conditions align.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
2. **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
3. **Historical Volatility (HV)** – Calculated as the standard deviation of past price changes over a defined lookback period (e.g., 20 days).  
4. **Volatility Percentiles** – Requires historical HV data to determine the 20th and 80th percentile thresholds.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets with intermittent low-volatility phases.  
- Avoid using in highly volatile or choppy markets where false crossovers are frequent.  
- Backtest to optimize the HV lookback period and percentile thresholds for the asset being traded.  

This strategy combines trend-following with volatility filtering to improve trade quality by avoiding high-risk environments.
