STRATEGY_NAME: NocturnalReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The NocturnalReversal strategy is a specialized approach designed to capitalize on overnight price reversals during range-bound market conditions. It focuses on identifying specific candlestick patterns and market contexts to enter long positions with high probability setups.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Market Context: The strategy operates exclusively during range-bound consolidation phases, avoiding trending markets.
2. Candlestick Pattern: Identifies two consecutive "hanging candles" (bearish reversal patterns) during overnight trading.
3. Size Requirement: The second hanging candle must be at least 10% larger than the first.
4. Timeframe: Focuses on overnight price action, typically between market close and open.

Entry Rules:
1. Confirm the market is in a range-bound consolidation phase (use Bollinger Bands or ATR to verify).
2. Identify two consecutive hanging candles during overnight trading.
3. Verify the second hanging candle is at least 10% larger than the first.
4. Enter a long position at the opening of the next trading session after pattern confirmation.

Exit Rules:
1. Set a stop-loss below the low of the second hanging candle.
2. Take profit at the upper boundary of the consolidation range.
3. Exit if the price breaks below the consolidation range.

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade.
2. Maximum stop-loss distance should not exceed 2% of account equity.
3. Use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2.
4. Avoid trading during major news events or high volatility periods.

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) to identify range-bound conditions.
2. Average True Range (ATR) to confirm consolidation.
3. Volume indicator to validate pattern significance.

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest the strategy on multiple instruments to confirm its effectiveness.
- Consider using a confirmation filter (e.g., RSI above 30) to increase reliability.
- Monitor overnight session volume to ensure sufficient liquidity.
- Adjust the 10% size requirement based on the instrument's volatility characteristics.

This strategy combines technical pattern recognition with market context analysis to identify high-probability reversal opportunities during specific market conditions. The focus on overnight price action and range-bound markets provides a unique edge in capturing early trend reversals.
