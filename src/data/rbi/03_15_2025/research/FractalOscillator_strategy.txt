It seems the strategy content is incomplete. Please provide the full details of the backtesting idea or trading strategy so I can analyze it and create a unique name along with detailed instructions. 

For example, if you could provide:
- The indicators used
- Entry/exit conditions
- Timeframe
- Any specific rules or filters
- Risk management approach

I can then create a unique strategy name and detailed analysis based on the complete information. Let me know when you have the full strategy details!
