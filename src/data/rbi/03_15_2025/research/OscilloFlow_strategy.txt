STRATEGY_NAME: OscilloFlow

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The OscilloFlow strategy combines the Stochastic Oscillator and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) to generate trading signals. This approach leverages momentum and volume-based indicators to identify high-probability entry and exit points in trending markets.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator**: Measures the momentum of price movements by comparing the closing price to its price range over a specific period. It consists of two lines: %K (fast line) and %D (slow line).
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**: A volume-based indicator that assesses the strength of buying and selling pressure by analyzing the accumulation/distribution line relative to price action.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Stochastic Oscillator: %K crosses above %D in the oversold zone (below 20).
   - CMF: Must be above the zero line, indicating bullish money flow.
   - Both conditions must align for a valid long signal.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Stochastic Oscillator: %K crosses below %D in the overbought zone (above 80).
   - CMF: Must be below the zero line, indicating bearish money flow.
   - Both conditions must align for a valid short signal.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Long Exit**:
   - Stochastic Oscillator: %K crosses below %D in the overbought zone (above 80).
   - CMF: Drops below the zero line, indicating weakening bullish momentum.
   - Exit when either condition is met.

2. **Short Exit**:
   - Stochastic Oscillator: %K crosses above %D in the oversold zone (below 20).
   - CMF: Rises above the zero line, indicating weakening bearish momentum.
   - Exit when either condition is met.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop Loss**:
   - Set a stop loss below the recent swing low for long positions or above the recent swing high for short positions.
   - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2% of account equity) or ATR-based stop loss.

2. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your account on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on stop-loss distance to maintain consistent risk.

3. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a trailing stop or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1).
   - Alternatively, exit when the Stochastic Oscillator reaches the opposite extreme (overbought for long trades, oversold for short trades).

### Required Indicators:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator**:
   - Period: 14 (default)
   - %K: 3 (default)
   - %D: 3 (default)
   - Overbought: 80
   - Oversold: 20

2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**:
   - Period: 20 (default)
   - Zero line as the threshold for bullish/bearish signals.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy performs best in trending markets. Avoid trading during choppy or sideways conditions.
- Use higher timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, or daily) for more reliable signals.
- Combine with price action or trend confirmation tools (e.g., moving averages) to filter out false signals.

By combining momentum (Stochastic Oscillator) and volume (CMF), OscilloFlow provides a robust framework for identifying high-probability trades while managing risk effectively.
