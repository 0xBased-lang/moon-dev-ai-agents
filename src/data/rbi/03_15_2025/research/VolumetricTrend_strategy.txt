STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricTrend strategy is a trend-following approach that combines moving average crossovers with volume confirmation and uses ATR-based exits for dynamic risk management. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

### Key Components:
1. **Trend Identification**: Uses a 10-period and 50-period Moving Average (MA) crossover to identify the direction of the trend.
2. **Volume Confirmation**: Requires higher-than-average volume during the crossover to validate the strength of the trend.
3. **Dynamic Exit**: Uses multiples of the Average True Range (ATR) to determine exit points, adapting to market volatility.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - The 10-period MA crosses above the 50-period MA.
   - Volume during the crossover is higher than the average volume over the last 20 periods.
   - Enter a long position at the close of the crossover candle.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - The 10-period MA crosses below the 50-period MA.
   - Volume during the crossover is higher than the average volume over the last 20 periods.
   - Enter a short position at the close of the crossover candle.

---

### Exit Rules:
1. **Long Exit**:
   - Exit the long position when the price moves below the entry price minus a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR).
   - Alternatively, exit if the 10-period MA crosses back below the 50-period MA.

2. **Short Exit**:
   - Exit the short position when the price moves above the entry price plus a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR).
   - Alternatively, exit if the 10-period MA crosses back above the 50-period MA.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account balance).
2. **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss at the ATR multiple level (e.g., 1.5x ATR) from the entry price.
3. **Take Profit**: No fixed take profit; let the ATR-based exit or MA crossover determine the exit.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Moving Averages**:
   - 10-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
   - 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
2. **Volume**:
   - 20-period Average Volume.
3. **ATR**:
   - 14-period Average True Range (ATR).

### Example Setup:
- **Long Trade**:
  - 10-period MA crosses above 50-period MA.
  - Volume is 20% higher than the 20-period average.
  - Enter long at the close of the crossover candle.
  - Set stop loss at 1.5x ATR below the entry price.
  - Exit when price drops below the stop loss or the 10-period MA crosses back below the 50-period MA.

- **Short Trade**:
  - 10-period MA crosses below 50-period MA.
  - Volume is 20% higher than the 20-period average.
  - Enter short at the close of the crossover candle.
  - Set stop loss at 1.5x ATR above the entry price.
  - Exit when price rises above the stop loss or the 10-period MA crosses back above the 50-period MA.

### Key Advantages:
- Combines trend-following with volume confirmation for higher accuracy.
- Uses ATR for dynamic exits, adapting to market volatility.
- Simple yet effective rules for both entry and exit.

### Key Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets; may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.
- Requires careful selection of ATR multiples to balance risk and reward.
- Volume confirmation helps filter out false signals but may reduce the number of trades in low-volume markets.
