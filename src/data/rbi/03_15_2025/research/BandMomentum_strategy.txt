STRATEGY_NAME: BandMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandMomentum strategy is a momentum-based trading approach that utilizes Bollinger Bands to identify potential long and short opportunities. The strategy focuses on the cumulative product of the 50-period Bollinger Bands' lower bands to determine market direction and momentum.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (50-period)
2. Cumulative product calculation
3. Standard deviation-based stop-loss

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry: When the cumulative product of the 50-period Bollinger Bands' lower bands is positive, indicating upward momentum.
2. Short Entry: When the cumulative product of the 50-period Bollinger Bands' lower bands is negative, indicating downward momentum.

Exit Rules:
1. Stop-Loss: Set at 2 standard deviations away from the mid-point of the Bollinger Bands.
2. Take-Profit: Not explicitly defined in the strategy; consider using a trailing stop or a fixed risk-reward ratio.

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on account size and risk tolerance.
2. Use the 2 standard deviation stop-loss to limit potential losses.
3. Consider implementing a maximum daily loss limit to protect against adverse market conditions.

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (50-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Cumulative product calculation of the lower bands

Additional Considerations:
1. Backtest the strategy on historical data to assess its performance.
2. Consider adding a confirmation indicator (e.g., RSI or MACD) to filter out false signals.
3. Monitor market conditions and adjust parameters as needed to adapt to changing volatility.

This strategy is best suited for traders who are comfortable with momentum-based approaches and have a good understanding of Bollinger Bands and standard deviation concepts. As with any trading strategy, proper risk management and discipline are crucial for long-term success.
