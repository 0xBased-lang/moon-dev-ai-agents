STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentReversion strategy is a mean-reversion approach that combines RSI divergence, ADX trend strength, and ATR-based exit levels to identify short opportunities in bearish market conditions. This strategy is designed to capitalize on overextended price movements and potential reversals.

Key Components:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Used to identify oversold conditions and divergence patterns
2. ADX (Average Directional Index) - Measures trend strength and direction
3. ATR (Average True Range) - Determines exit levels based on volatility

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for RSI to drop below 20, indicating oversold conditions
2. Confirm bearish divergence: Price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows
3. Verify ADX is above 25 and the -DI line is above the +DI line, confirming bearish trend strength
4. Enter short position when all conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Calculate ATR-based exit levels:
   - First target: 1x ATR below entry price
   - Second target: 2x ATR below entry price
2. Use a trailing stop based on 0.5x ATR to protect profits
3. Exit entire position if price moves against the trade by 1x ATR

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 3%
3. Maximum weekly loss limit of 5%
4. Stop-loss set at 1x ATR above entry price

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14-period)
2. ADX (14-period)
3. ATR (14-period)

Additional Notes:
- This strategy performs best in ranging or mildly trending markets
- Avoid trading during high-impact news events
- Monitor for potential trend reversals using price action confirmation
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on market volatility (higher multipliers for more volatile markets)

Optimization Tips:
- Test different RSI periods (10-20) for specific instruments
- Experiment with ADX thresholds (20-30) for trend confirmation
- Adjust ATR multipliers based on individual risk tolerance and market conditions

This strategy combines the precision of divergence patterns with the reliability of trend strength indicators and volatility-based exits, creating a robust mean-reversion approach for bearish market conditions.
