STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumSurge strategy is a momentum-based approach that combines moving average crossovers, RSI oversold conditions, and volume spikes to identify high-probability long entries. The strategy focuses on catching strong upward momentum after a period of consolidation or weakness.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Moving Averages: Uses 50-period and 200-period moving averages to identify the overall trend direction.
2. RSI: 14-period RSI to detect oversold conditions.
3. Volume: Measures volume spikes to confirm increasing buying pressure.
4. ATR: 14-period ATR for dynamic stop-loss placement.

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the 50-period moving average to cross above the 200-period moving average (Golden Cross).
2. Confirm the RSI(14) is below 30, indicating oversold conditions.
3. Verify that volume has increased by more than 10% in the last 5 minutes compared to the previous 5-minute period.
4. Enter a long position when all three conditions are met.

Exit Rules:
1. Set a stop-loss at 2 times the 14-period ATR below the entry price.
2. Consider taking profits when RSI(14) reaches overbought levels (above 70) or when the 50-period moving average crosses below the 200-period moving average (Death Cross).

Risk Management:
1. Position size should be calculated based on the distance between entry price and stop-loss level to maintain consistent risk per trade.
2. Maximum risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of total account equity.
3. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods.

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)
2. 200-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)
3. 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI)
4. Volume indicator
5. 14-period Average True Range (ATR)

Additional Considerations:
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may produce false signals in choppy or sideways markets.
- Consider using this strategy on liquid assets with sufficient volatility.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters for specific markets.
- Monitor the overall market context and avoid trading against strong bearish trends.

The MomentumSurge strategy aims to capture strong upward moves by combining trend confirmation, oversold conditions, and volume confirmation, while using ATR-based stops to manage risk effectively.
