STRATEGY_NAME: StochasticSync

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The StochasticSync strategy combines the Stochastic Oscillator with Moving Averages to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This approach leverages the momentum signals from the Stochastic Oscillator while using Moving Averages to confirm the overall trend direction. The strategy is designed to work in trending markets and aims to capture reversals or continuations in price movements.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)**:
   - Measures momentum by comparing the closing price to the price range over a specific period.
   - Generates overbought (>80) and oversold (<20) signals.
   - %K (fast line) and %D (slow line) crossovers are used for entry signals.

2. **Moving Averages (50 SMA and 200 SMA)**:
   - 50 SMA: Short-term trend filter.
   - 200 SMA: Long-term trend filter.
   - The relationship between the two MAs (50 SMA above/below 200 SMA) determines the overall trend bias.

3. **Trend Confirmation**:
   - The strategy only takes trades in the direction of the dominant trend, as confirmed by the Moving Averages.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - 50 SMA must be above the 200 SMA (bullish trend).
   - Stochastic Oscillator crosses above 20 (oversold condition).
   - %K line crosses above the %D line (momentum confirmation).

2. **Short Entry**:
   - 50 SMA must be below the 200 SMA (bearish trend).
   - Stochastic Oscillator crosses below 80 (overbought condition).
   - %K line crosses below the %D line (momentum confirmation).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Close the trade when the Stochastic Oscillator reaches the opposite threshold (80 for long trades, 20 for short trades).
   - Alternatively, use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss below the recent swing low for long trades or above the recent swing high for short trades.
   - Alternatively, use a percentage-based stop loss (e.g., 1-2% of account equity).

3. **Trend Reversal Exit**:
   - Exit the trade if the 50 SMA crosses below the 200 SMA (for long trades) or above the 200 SMA (for short trades).

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of account equity per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on stop loss distance.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or market.
   - Use the strategy across multiple timeframes or instruments.

3. **Avoid Overtrading**:
   - Only take trades that meet all entry criteria.
   - Wait for clear signals and avoid trading during choppy or sideways markets.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)**:
   - Settings: %K period = 14, %D period = 3, smoothing = 3.

2. **Simple Moving Averages (50 SMA and 200 SMA)**:
   - 50 SMA: Short-term trend filter.
   - 200 SMA: Long-term trend filter.

### Additional Notes:
- **Timeframe**: This strategy works best on daily or 4-hour charts for swing trading.
- **Market Conditions**: Ideal for trending markets. Avoid using the strategy during periods of low volatility or consolidation.
- **Optimization**: Backtest the strategy on historical data to fine-tune parameters (e.g., Stochastic settings, Moving Average periods) for specific assets.

By combining the momentum signals from the Stochastic Oscillator with the trend confirmation from Moving Averages, the StochasticSync strategy provides a systematic approach to trading with clear entry and exit rules.
