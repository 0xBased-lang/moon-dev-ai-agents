STRATEGY_NAME: CrossVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The CrossVolatility strategy combines a dual moving average crossover system with volatility-based profit targets and dynamic stop-loss placement. This approach aims to capture trending markets while managing risk using recent price action and market volatility.

Key Components:
1. Moving Averages:
   - 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   - 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. Volatility Measurement:
   - Average True Range (ATR) for profit target calculation
3. Price Action:
   - Previous swing high for stop-loss placement

Entry Rules:
1. Go long when:
   - 50 SMA crosses above 200 EMA (Golden Cross)
   - Price is above both moving averages
   - Confirmation candle closes above the crossover point

Exit Rules:
1. Take-Profit:
   - Set at 20% of current ATR value from entry price
   - Example: If ATR is 10, take-profit is set at 2 points above entry
2. Stop-Loss:
   - Placed at the previous swing high
   - Must be below the entry price
   - Minimum distance of 10% ATR from entry price

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
   - Calculate position size based on stop-loss distance
2. Trade Filter:
   - Only trade when ATR is above its 20-period average
   - Avoid trading during low volatility periods
3. Time Filter:
   - Only take trades during active market hours
   - Avoid trading during major news events

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period recommended

Additional Notes:
- Use this strategy on daily or 4-hour timeframes for best results
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Backtest thoroughly across different market conditions
- Adjust ATR percentage based on market volatility and personal risk tolerance

This strategy combines trend-following principles with volatility-based profit targets, creating a balanced approach to capturing trends while managing risk through dynamic stop-loss placement and ATR-based profit targets.
