STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBollinger

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricBollinger strategy is a unique approach that combines Bollinger Bands analysis with precise volume conditions to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy focuses on low volatility periods with unusually high trading volume, creating a setup for potential breakout or reversal trades.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands Width: Monitors the volatility of the asset by tracking the distance between the upper and lower bands
2. Volume Analysis: Requires exact doubling of the average daily trading volume
3. Position Sizing: Initiates a 50% long position to maintain risk control
4. Time Constraint: Executes trades only within a specific 30-minute window

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Bands width to contract below 2 standard deviations
2. Confirm that current trading volume is exactly 200% of the average daily volume
3. Enter a 50% long position within the next 30 minutes of these conditions being met

Exit Rules:
1. Set stop-loss at 20% above the entry price
2. Set take-profit at 10% below the entry price
3. Exit the position if either target is hit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing limited to 50% of available capital
2. Stop-loss placement at 20% above entry price
3. Risk-reward ratio of 2:1 (20% stop-loss vs 10% take-profit)
4. Strict volume condition filters out low-probability trades

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume indicator (to calculate average daily volume)
3. Real-time volume tracker (to confirm exact 200% volume condition)

Additional Considerations:
1. Backtest the strategy to confirm the effectiveness of the exact 200% volume condition
2. Consider implementing a time-based exit if neither target is hit within a specific period
3. Monitor for potential slippage due to the precise volume requirement
4. Adjust position sizing based on account size and risk tolerance

This strategy is particularly suited for traders who prefer precise, rule-based systems with clear entry and exit criteria. The combination of low volatility (Bollinger Bands width) and high volume creates a unique setup that could indicate potential price movements. However, the exact volume requirement may limit trading opportunities, making this a potentially low-frequency but high-conviction strategy.
