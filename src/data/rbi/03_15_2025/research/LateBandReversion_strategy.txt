STRATEGY_NAME: LateBandReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The LateBandReversion strategy is a mean-reversion approach designed to capitalize on overextended price movements during late-day trading sessions. It uses Bollinger Bands as the primary indicator to identify potential reversal opportunities when prices breach the upper or lower bands.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Late-day session timing (last 2 hours of trading)
3. Mean-reversion logic
4. Band-based exit signals

Entry Rules:
1. Identify the last 2 hours of the trading session
2. Wait for price to breach the upper Bollinger Band
3. Enter a short position when the breach occurs
4. (Optional) For long positions, wait for price to breach the lower Bollinger Band

Exit Rules:
1. For short positions: Exit when price closes below the upper Bollinger Band
2. For long positions: Exit when price closes above the lower Bollinger Band
3. Implement a time-based exit at market close if no signal occurs

Risk Management:
1. Set a stop-loss at 1.5x the average true range (ATR) from entry point
2. Use position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
3. Avoid trading during high-impact news events
4. Limit trades to 2 per session (1 long, 1 short)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Average True Range (14) for stop-loss calculation
3. Session timing indicator (to identify last 2 hours)

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest on multiple timeframes (15min, 30min, 1hr)
- Focus on liquid assets with tight spreads
- Monitor volume during late sessions for confirmation
- Consider adding RSI (14) as a confirmation filter (overbought/oversold)

This strategy is particularly effective in range-bound markets and during periods of low volatility expansion. The late-day focus helps capture institutional rebalancing and profit-taking moves that often create mean-reversion opportunities.
