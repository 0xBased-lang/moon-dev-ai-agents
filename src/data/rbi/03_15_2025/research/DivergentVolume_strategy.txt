STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentVolume

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentVolume strategy is a trend-following approach that combines MACD histogram divergence signals with volume-based confirmation to identify high-probability entry points during strong market movements. The strategy focuses on aligning momentum and volume indicators to confirm trend strength and potential reversals.

### Key Components:
1. **MACD Histogram Divergence**: 
   - Used to identify momentum shifts and potential trend reversals.
   - Positive divergence occurs when the MACD histogram forms higher lows while price forms lower lows, signaling potential bullish momentum.

2. **Volume Ratio**:
   - Measures the strength of the trend by comparing recent volume to historical volume.
   - A rising Volume Ratio confirms strong participation in the trend, adding validity to the MACD divergence signal.

3. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - Used for setting dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels based on market volatility.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Confirmation of Positive Divergence**:
   - MACD histogram must show higher lows while price shows lower lows (bullish divergence).
   - Volume Ratio must be rising, indicating increasing buying pressure.

2. **Trend Alignment**:
   - Price must be above a key moving average (e.g., 50-period EMA) to confirm an uptrend.

3. **Entry Trigger**:
   - Enter a long position when the MACD histogram crosses above the zero line after a positive divergence, and the Volume Ratio is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 1.2).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Price Reversal**:
   - Exit the trade if the price closes below a recent swing low or a key support level.

2. **ATR-Based Exit**:
   - Set a trailing stop-loss at 2x ATR below the entry price.
   - Take profit at 3x ATR above the entry price.

3. **MACD Signal Line Cross**:
   - Exit if the MACD line crosses below the signal line, indicating weakening momentum.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
   - Use ATR to calculate position size based on the distance to the stop-loss level.

2. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
   - Initial stop-loss is placed at 2x ATR below the entry price.
   - Trailing stop-loss is adjusted as the price moves in favor of the trade.

3. **Take-Profit Levels**:
   - Primary take-profit is set at 3x ATR above the entry price.
   - Secondary take-profit can be set at key resistance levels or when the Volume Ratio starts to decline.

### Required Indicators:
1. **MACD (12, 26, 9)**:
   - Focus on the histogram for divergence signals.

2. **Volume Ratio**:
   - Calculate as (Current Volume / Average Volume over the last 20 periods).

3. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - Use a 14-period ATR for volatility-based exits.

4. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
   - 50-period EMA to confirm the overall trend direction.

### Summary:
The DivergentVolume strategy leverages the synergy between momentum divergence and volume confirmation to identify high-probability trend-following opportunities. By combining MACD histogram analysis with Volume Ratio and ATR-based exits, the strategy aims to capture strong market movements while managing risk effectively. This approach is particularly effective in trending markets with clear momentum shifts and strong volume participation.
