STRATEGY_NAME: BandedMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandedMomentum strategy combines Bollinger Bands and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential breakout opportunities. This approach leverages the volatility and momentum indicators to pinpoint high-probability entry and exit points.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bollinger Bands: Used to measure volatility and identify potential breakout levels.
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Used to gauge momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.

Entry Rules:
1. Look for price to touch or cross the upper Bollinger Band.
2. Confirm with RSI above 70 (overbought condition) for a potential short entry.
3. Look for price to touch or cross the lower Bollinger Band.
4. Confirm with RSI below 30 (oversold condition) for a potential long entry.

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions, exit when price crosses back inside the Bollinger Bands or RSI moves above 70.
2. For short positions, exit when price crosses back inside the Bollinger Bands or RSI moves below 30.

Risk Management:
1. Set stop-loss orders just outside the opposite Bollinger Band.
2. Use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2.
3. Position size should be calculated based on account risk tolerance (e.g., 1-2% of account per trade).

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Relative Strength Index (14-period)

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets.
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation.
- Adjust Bollinger Band settings based on market volatility.
- Use higher timeframes (4-hour or daily) for more reliable signals.

Remember to backtest this strategy thoroughly before applying it to live trading, and always follow proper risk management principles.
