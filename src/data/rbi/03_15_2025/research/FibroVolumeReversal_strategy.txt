STRATEGY_NAME: FibroVolumeReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroVolumeReversal strategy is a sophisticated trend-following approach that combines Fibonacci retracement levels with volume spikes to identify high-probability reversal points. This strategy is designed to capitalize on price movements after retracements within a prevailing trend, using volume as a confirmation signal for entry.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: 
   - Identify the most recent significant swing high and swing low in the current trend.
   - Draw Fibonacci retracement levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%) between these points.
   - Focus on the 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels as key reversal zones.

2. **Volume Spikes**:
   - Use a volume indicator to detect spikes in trading volume.
   - A volume spike is defined as a volume bar that is at least 2x the average volume of the last 20 bars.

3. **Price Reversals**:
   - Look for price reversals (e.g., bullish engulfing, pin bars, or divergence) at or near the key Fibonacci levels.
   - The reversal should coincide with a volume spike for confirmation.

### Entry Rules:
- **Long Entry**:
  - Price retraces to a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) in an uptrend.
  - A bullish reversal pattern forms at or near the Fibonacci level.
  - A volume spike occurs simultaneously with the reversal pattern.
  - Enter a long position at the close of the reversal candle.

- **Short Entry**:
  - Price retraces to a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) in a downtrend.
  - A bearish reversal pattern forms at or near the Fibonacci level.
  - A volume spike occurs simultaneously with the reversal pattern.
  - Enter a short position at the close of the reversal candle.

### Exit Rules:
- **Take Profit**:
  - Set the take profit level at the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2% or 161.8%) or a recent swing high/low.
  - Alternatively, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trend continues.

- **Stop Loss**:
  - Place the stop loss just below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
  - Ensure the stop loss is outside the Fibonacci retracement zone to avoid premature exits.

### Risk Management:
- Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
- Adjust position size based on the distance between the entry point and the stop loss to maintain consistent risk exposure.
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events to reduce false signals.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: To identify key retracement levels.
2. **Volume Indicator**: To detect volume spikes (e.g., standard volume or a custom volume spike indicator).
3. **Candlestick Patterns**: To identify reversal patterns (e.g., engulfing, pin bars, or divergence).

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets. Avoid using it in choppy or sideways markets.
- Combine with other trend confirmation tools (e.g., moving averages or trendlines) for higher accuracy.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to find the most suitable one for your trading style.

By combining Fibonacci retracement levels with volume spikes and price reversals, the FibroVolumeReversal strategy offers a robust framework for identifying high-probability trade setups in trending markets.
