STRATEGY_NAME: FibBandSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibBandSqueeze strategy combines Fibonacci retracement levels with Bollinger Bands to identify high-probability trade setups during periods of consolidation and breakout. The strategy focuses on price confirmation at key support/resistance levels while leveraging the narrowing range of Bollinger Bands to anticipate potential breakouts.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Used to identify key support and resistance levels based on recent price swings.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: Used to detect periods of low volatility (narrowing bands) and potential breakout opportunities.
3. **Price Confirmation**: Requires price to clearly break or reject a Fibonacci level with strong candlestick patterns.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Setup Conditions**:
   - Identify a recent significant price swing (high to low or low to high).
   - Draw Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) on the swing.
   - Observe Bollinger Bands narrowing (squeeze) near a key Fibonacci level (support or resistance).

2. **Long Entry**:
   - Price is near a Fibonacci support level (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%).
   - Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating low volatility.
   - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band with strong bullish momentum (e.g., a large bullish candle closing above the band).
   - Confirm with volume increase or a bullish candlestick pattern (e.g., engulfing, hammer).

3. **Short Entry**:
   - Price is near a Fibonacci resistance level.
   - Bollinger Bands are narrowing.
   - Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band with strong bearish momentum (e.g., a large bearish candle closing below the band).
   - Confirm with volume increase or a bearish candlestick pattern (e.g., shooting star, bearish engulfing).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set take profit at the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2% or 161.8%).
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on Bollinger Band movement or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
   - Alternatively, use the opposite Bollinger Band as a dynamic stop loss.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.

2. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Only trade setups with a clear Fibonacci level and Bollinger Band squeeze.
   - Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Apply the strategy across multiple timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, daily) and instruments to diversify risk.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
   - Available on most trading platforms.
   - Use to plot key levels based on recent price swings.

2. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Default settings (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).
   - Use to identify narrowing ranges and potential breakouts.

3. **Volume Indicator (Optional)**:
   - Use to confirm breakout strength.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear support/resistance levels.
- Avoid using it in choppy or sideways markets where Bollinger Bands may give false signals.
- Combine with other technical tools (e.g., RSI, MACD) for additional confirmation if needed.

By combining Fibonacci levels with Bollinger Band squeezes, the FibBandSqueeze strategy provides a structured approach to trading breakouts with defined risk-reward parameters.
