STRATEGY_NAME: StochasticBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The StochasticBreakout strategy is a high-frequency trading approach that combines the Stochastic Oscillator and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify breakout opportunities in volatile markets. This strategy is designed for short-term traders who aim to capitalize on rapid price movements.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator**: Used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. The default settings are typically %K (14) and %D (3).
2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Used to confirm momentum and strength of the breakout. The default setting is typically 14 periods.
3. **Price Action**: Focuses on breakouts above resistance or below support levels.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Stochastic Oscillator: %K crosses above %D in the oversold zone (below 20).
   - RSI: Confirms momentum by being above 50.
   - Price: Breaks above a recent resistance level.
   - Enter a long position when all three conditions are met.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Stochastic Oscillator: %K crosses below %D in the overbought zone (above 80).
   - RSI: Confirms momentum by being below 50.
   - Price: Breaks below a recent support level.
   - Enter a short position when all three conditions are met.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a fixed percentage or price target based on recent volatility (e.g., 1-2% above/below entry).
   - Alternatively, exit when the Stochastic Oscillator reaches the opposite extreme (overbought for long trades, oversold for short trades).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss just below the breakout level for long trades or above the breakout level for short trades.
   - Use a fixed percentage (e.g., 0.5-1%) or a recent swing low/high as the stop loss level.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss levels.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid concentrating all trades in a single asset or sector.
   - Spread trades across multiple instruments to reduce risk.

3. **Timeframe**:
   - This strategy is best suited for 5-minute or 15-minute charts for high-frequency trading.
   - Avoid holding positions overnight to minimize exposure to gap risk.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator** (%K: 14, %D: 3).
2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** (14 periods).
3. **Support and Resistance Levels** (identified using recent price action).

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or highly volatile markets.
- Avoid using it during low-volume or sideways market conditions, as false breakouts are more likely.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters and ensure consistency.

By combining the Stochastic Oscillator and RSI with breakout levels, the StochasticBreakout strategy provides a systematic approach to capturing short-term price movements while managing risk effectively.
