STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumSynergy

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumSynergy strategy is a momentum-based approach that combines MACD and RSI indicators to confirm strong trending conditions. It uses the correlation between these two indicators as a key signal for entering and exiting trades, with a dynamic position sizing mechanism to capitalize on winning streaks.

Key Components:
1. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
3. Correlation analysis between MACD and RSI
4. Dynamic position sizing based on trade success

Entry Rules:
- Calculate the correlation coefficient between MACD and RSI over a specified period (e.g., 14 periods)
- Enter a long position when the correlation crosses above 0.7
- The correlation threshold indicates strong alignment between momentum indicators

Exit Rules:
- Exit the position when the correlation between MACD and RSI crosses below 0.7
- This indicates weakening momentum alignment

Position Sizing:
- Start with a base position size (e.g., 1% of account equity)
- Increase position size by 20% after each successful trade
- Reset to base position size after a losing trade
- Example progression: 1% → 1.2% → 1.44% → 1.728%

Risk Management:
- Set a maximum position size cap (e.g., 5% of account equity)
- Use a stop-loss based on ATR or percentage of account equity
- Implement a maximum drawdown limit for the strategy
- Consider a maximum number of consecutive position size increases

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12, 26, 9 standard settings)
2. RSI (14 period standard setting)
3. Correlation calculation between MACD and RSI
4. Optional: ATR for stop-loss placement

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest the strategy with different correlation thresholds
- Test various timeframes to find optimal performance
- Consider adding a volatility filter to avoid trading in choppy markets
- Monitor the correlation window length for optimal results

This strategy aims to capitalize on strong momentum trends while using the correlation between two popular indicators as a confirmation tool. The dynamic position sizing adds a compounding effect to winning streaks while maintaining risk control through the reset mechanism after losses.
