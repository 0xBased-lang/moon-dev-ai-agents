STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicDivergence strategy combines volatility breakout techniques with RSI divergence signals to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This strategy is designed to capitalize on sudden price movements during periods of increased volatility while using RSI divergence as a confirmation tool to filter out false breakouts.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volatility Breakout**: 
   - Uses Average True Range (ATR) to measure market volatility.
   - Identifies breakout levels based on recent price action and volatility.

2. **RSI Divergence**:
   - Uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to detect divergence between price and momentum.
   - Bullish divergence occurs when price makes a lower low but RSI makes a higher low.
   - Bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher high but RSI makes a lower high.

3. **Entry Confirmation**:
   - Requires both a volatility breakout and RSI divergence to confirm the trade.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Entry**:
   - Price breaks above the upper volatility band (calculated as: Close + (ATR * Multiplier)).
   - RSI shows bullish divergence (price makes a lower low, RSI makes a higher low).
   - Enter a long position on the breakout candle close.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - Price breaks below the lower volatility band (calculated as: Close - (ATR * Multiplier)).
   - RSI shows bearish divergence (price makes a higher high, RSI makes a lower high).
   - Enter a short position on the breakout candle close.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1) based on the ATR value at the time of entry.
   - Alternatively, exit when RSI reaches overbought (70) or oversold (30) levels.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place the stop loss below the recent swing low for long trades or above the recent swing high for short trades.
   - Alternatively, use a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR) to set the stop loss.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.

2. **Volatility Filter**:
   - Avoid trading during extremely low volatility periods (e.g., ATR below a certain threshold).

### Required Indicators:
1. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - Period: 14 (default).
   - Used to calculate volatility bands and stop loss levels.

2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - Period: 14 (default).
   - Used to identify divergence and overbought/oversold conditions.

3. **Volatility Bands**:
   - Upper Band: Close + (ATR * Multiplier).
   - Lower Band: Close - (ATR * Multiplier).
   - Multiplier: Adjustable (e.g., 1.5 or 2).

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to reduce noise.
- Backtest the strategy with different ATR multipliers and RSI settings to optimize for specific markets.
- Combine with fundamental analysis or news events to avoid trading during major announcements that could cause erratic price movements.

By combining volatility breakout signals with RSI divergence, the VoltaicDivergence strategy aims to provide a robust framework for identifying high-probability trades while minimizing false signals.
