STRATEGY_NAME: YieldCurveReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The YieldCurveReversal strategy is a unique approach that combines macroeconomic indicators with technical analysis to identify potential market reversals. It focuses on the relationship between the VIX futures curve and the 3-month Treasury yield, using their divergence as a signal for long positions. The strategy incorporates a moving average crossover for exit signals, ensuring a systematic approach to risk management.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **VIX Futures Curve (30 days)**: Measures market volatility expectations.
2. **3-Month Treasury Yield**: Represents short-term interest rates and risk-free returns.
3. **50-Period Moving Average (MA)**: Used as a trend-following tool for exit signals.

### Entry Rules:
- **Long Entry**: Enter a long position when the difference between the VIX futures curve (30 days) and the 3-month Treasury yield is negative. This indicates that market volatility expectations are lower than the risk-free rate, suggesting potential market complacency and a possible reversal opportunity.

### Exit Rules:
- **Exit Signal**: Close the long position when the price crosses below the 50-period Moving Average. This crossover indicates a potential shift in trend momentum, signaling a neutral or bearish outlook.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Allocate a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to limit exposure.
2. **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss below a recent swing low or based on a percentage of the entry price (e.g., 2-3%).
3. **Take Profit**: Consider a trailing stop or a fixed profit target (e.g., 5-10%) to lock in gains.

### Required Indicators:
1. **VIX Futures Curve (30 days)**: Available from financial data providers.
2. **3-Month Treasury Yield**: Accessible through economic data platforms or central bank reports.
3. **50-Period Moving Average**: Can be calculated using price data from any trading platform.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in environments where volatility expectations and interest rates are closely monitored, such as during periods of economic uncertainty or central bank policy shifts.
- Backtesting is recommended to validate the strategy's performance across different market conditions.
- Consider combining this strategy with other macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation data, GDP growth) for enhanced signal confirmation.
