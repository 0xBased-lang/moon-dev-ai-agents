STRATEGY_NAME: VolBandBreach

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolBandBreach strategy combines Bollinger Bands, volume analysis, and ATR-based exits to identify high-probability breakout trades during periods of significant market activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Key Components**:
   - Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
   - Volume threshold (50% of average daily volume)
   - 2-day Average True Range (ATR) for exit timing

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - Wait for price to close above the upper Bollinger Band
   - Confirm volume is at least 50% higher than the average daily volume
   - Enter a long position at the next candle's open

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - Set initial stop-loss at the lower Bollinger Band
   - Exit the trade when price touches or crosses the lower band
   - Maximum holding period is 2 ATR periods (calculated daily)

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Position size based on 1% risk per trade
   - Stop-loss distance calculated from entry to lower band
   - No trades taken if ATR exceeds 3% of current price (high volatility filter)

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2)
   - Volume indicator
   - 14-period ATR

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volume patterns
   - Avoid trading during major news events
   - Works well on daily and 4-hour timeframes
   - Combine with fundamental analysis for higher conviction trades

7. **Optimization Tips**:
   - Adjust volume threshold based on asset class
   - Test different ATR periods for exit timing
   - Consider adding a momentum filter (e.g., RSI > 50) for additional confirmation

This strategy aims to capture strong momentum moves while using volatility-based parameters to manage risk and exit positions effectively. The combination of volume confirmation and ATR-based exits helps filter out false breakouts while allowing for controlled risk exposure.
