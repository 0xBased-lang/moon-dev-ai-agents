STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumRipple

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumRipple strategy is a precision-based momentum trading approach that focuses on stocks exhibiting specific Relative Momentum Index (RMI) behavior over a 52-week period. The strategy combines long-term momentum filtering with short-term RMI-based entry and exit signals, creating a unique ripple effect in momentum trading.

Key Components:
1. **52-Week Momentum Filter**: Only stocks that have increased in price over the past 52 weeks are considered.
2. **RMI Precision Entry**: Stocks must show an exact R1 reading on the Relative Momentum Index (RMI) to qualify for entry.
3. **Position Sizing**: 70% of available capital is allocated to long positions in qualifying stocks.
4. **Stop-Loss Protection**: A fixed -20% stop-loss from the entry price is applied to all positions.
5. **Exit Signal**: Positions are closed when cumulative 5-day RMI gains exceed 3x the initial RMI reading.

Entry Rules:
1. Scan for stocks that have shown a positive price increase over the past 52 weeks.
2. Confirm the stock's RMI reading is exactly R1.
3. Enter a long position with 70% of available capital at the next available price after the R1 confirmation.

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor the cumulative 5-day RMI gains.
2. Close the position when the cumulative RMI gain exceeds 3x the initial R1 reading.
3. If the stop-loss at -20% is hit before the exit condition is met, exit the position immediately.

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing is capped at 70% of available capital to maintain portfolio diversification.
2. The -20% stop-loss ensures controlled risk exposure per trade.
3. The 3x RMI gain exit rule locks in profits while allowing for momentum continuation.

Required Indicators:
1. **Relative Momentum Index (RMI)**: Primary indicator for entry and exit signals.
2. **52-Week Price Change**: Filter for long-term momentum stocks.
3. **Cumulative RMI Calculation**: Custom calculation to track 5-day RMI gains.

This strategy is designed for traders who want to capitalize on precise momentum signals while maintaining strict risk control. The combination of long-term momentum filtering and short-term RMI precision creates a unique trading edge in trending markets.
