STRATEGY_NAME: BandBreakoutATR

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandBreakoutATR strategy combines Bollinger Bands and Average True Range (ATR) to identify potential breakout opportunities while managing risk effectively. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **Bollinger Bands (20-period)**:
   - Upper Band: 20-period SMA + (2 * Standard Deviation)
   - Lower Band: 20-period SMA - (2 * Standard Deviation)
   - Middle Band: 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)

2. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - Used to calculate a dynamic stop-loss level based on market volatility.

3. **Stop-Loss Mechanism**:
   - A fixed 10% stop-loss tied to the ATR value to protect against excessive losses.

---

### **Entry Rules**
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Trigger: When the **Upper Band** of the Bollinger Bands crosses **above** the 20-period SMA.
   - Confirmation: Ensure the price is trending upward and the crossover is accompanied by increasing volume (optional but recommended).

---

### **Exit Rules**
1. **Exit Condition 1**:
   - Close the position if the **Lower Band** touches or closes **below** the 20-period SMA.
   - This indicates a potential reversal or weakening of the trend.

2. **Exit Condition 2**:
   - Trigger a stop-loss if the price drops by **10%** of the ATR value from the entry point.
   - Example: If ATR is 2 at entry, the stop-loss is placed at 10% of 2 (0.2) below the entry price.

---

### **Risk Management**
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Use a fixed percentage of your capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to limit exposure.

2. **Stop-Loss**:
   - The 10% ATR-based stop-loss ensures that losses are controlled relative to market volatility.

3. **Take-Profit**:
   - No fixed take-profit level; rely on the Bollinger Bands' Lower Band or SMA crossover for exit signals.

---

### **Required Indicators**
1. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Period: 20
   - Standard Deviation: 2

2. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - Period: 14 (default)

---

### **Example Scenario**
1. **Entry**:
   - Upper Band crosses above the 20-period SMA at $100.
   - ATR value at entry is 2.
   - Stop-loss is set at $99.8 (100 - (10% of 2)).

2. **Exit**:
   - Lower Band touches or closes below the 20-period SMA at $105.
   - Exit the position at $105.

3. **Stop-Loss Trigger**:
   - If the price drops to $99.8 before the exit condition is met, the trade is closed at $99.8.

---

### **Advantages**
- Combines trend-following (Bollinger Bands) with volatility-based risk management (ATR).
- Dynamic stop-loss adapts to market conditions.

### **Limitations**
- May produce false signals in choppy or sideways markets.
- Requires careful monitoring of Bollinger Bands and ATR values.

This strategy is best suited for trending markets and should be tested thoroughly before live implementation.
