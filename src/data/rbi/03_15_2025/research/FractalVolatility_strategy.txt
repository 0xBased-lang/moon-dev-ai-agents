STRATEGY_NAME: FractalVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalVolatility strategy is a sophisticated trend-following approach that combines RSI (Relative Strength Index), ATR (Average True Range), and fractal analysis to identify high-probability entry points. The strategy focuses on confirming overbought/oversold conditions, measuring market volatility, and leveraging self-similar patterns in price action for precise entries.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
   - Used to identify overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) conditions.
   - Acts as a confirmation tool to ensure the market is not overextended before entering a trade.

2. **ATR (Average True Range):**
   - Measures market volatility to determine the strength of the trend.
   - Helps set appropriate stop-loss and take-profit levels based on current market conditions.

3. **Fractals:**
   - Identifies self-similar patterns in price action, which often signal potential reversals or continuations.
   - Fractals are used as entry signals when they align with RSI and ATR conditions.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry:**
   - RSI must be below 30 (oversold condition).
   - ATR must indicate increasing volatility (e.g., ATR value is above its moving average).
   - A bullish fractal pattern must form (a fractal with a higher low followed by a higher high).
   - All three conditions must align for a valid long entry.

2. **Short Entry:**
   - RSI must be above 70 (overbought condition).
   - ATR must indicate increasing volatility (e.g., ATR value is above its moving average).
   - A bearish fractal pattern must form (a fractal with a lower high followed by a lower low).
   - All three conditions must align for a valid short entry.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take-Profit:**
   - Use a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) to set a dynamic take-profit level.
   - Alternatively, exit when RSI reaches the opposite threshold (e.g., RSI > 70 for long trades or RSI < 30 for short trades).

2. **Stop-Loss:**
   - Place the stop-loss below the most recent fractal low for long trades or above the most recent fractal high for short trades.
   - Alternatively, use a fixed percentage or ATR-based stop-loss.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing:**
   - Use a fixed percentage of the account balance (e.g., 1-2%) per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on ATR to account for volatility.

2. **Diversification:**
   - Avoid overconcentration in a single asset or market.
   - Spread trades across multiple timeframes or instruments to reduce risk.

3. **Risk-Reward Ratio:**
   - Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2.
   - Ensure the potential reward justifies the risk taken.

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
   - Period: 14 (default).
   - Overbought level: 70.
   - Oversold level: 30.

2. **ATR (Average True Range):**
   - Period: 14 (default).
   - Use ATR to measure volatility and set stop-loss/take-profit levels.

3. **Fractals:**
   - Use the built-in fractal indicator or manually identify fractal patterns.
   - Look for self-similar patterns that align with RSI and ATR conditions.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear directional bias.
- Avoid using it in highly choppy or sideways markets, as false signals may increase.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes and assets to ensure robustness.

By combining RSI, ATR, and fractals, the FractalVolatility strategy provides a systematic and disciplined approach to trend-following, ensuring high-probability entries and effective risk management.
