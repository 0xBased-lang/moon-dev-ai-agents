STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicReversal strategy is a long-term volatility-based mean reversion strategy that utilizes the Stochastic Oscillator to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. This strategy is designed to capitalize on extreme price movements, anticipating a reversal when volatility reaches unsustainable levels.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Volatility Analysis**: The strategy focuses on identifying periods of high volatility, which often precede market reversals. This is achieved by monitoring price movements over a long-term period.
2. **Stochastic Oscillator**: The Stochastic Oscillator is used to determine overbought (above 80) and oversold (below 20) conditions, signaling potential reversal points.
3. **Mean Reversion Principle**: The strategy assumes that prices will revert to their mean after extreme movements, making it ideal for counter-trend trading.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Long Entry**:
   - Wait for the Stochastic Oscillator to drop below 20, indicating an oversold condition.
   - Confirm that the market has experienced a significant downward move (high volatility).
   - Enter a long position when the Stochastic Oscillator crosses back above 20, signaling a potential reversal.

2. **Short Entry**:
   - Wait for the Stochastic Oscillator to rise above 80, indicating an overbought condition.
   - Confirm that the market has experienced a significant upward move (high volatility).
   - Enter a short position when the Stochastic Oscillator crosses back below 80, signaling a potential reversal.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a take-profit level based on a percentage of the average true range (ATR) or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).
   - Alternatively, exit when the Stochastic Oscillator reaches the opposite threshold (80 for long trades, 20 for short trades).

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop-loss order below the recent swing low for long trades or above the recent swing high for short trades.
   - Use a volatility-based stop-loss (e.g., 1.5x ATR) to account for market fluctuations.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance between entry and stop-loss levels.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Apply the strategy across multiple uncorrelated assets to reduce risk.

3. **Avoid Overtrading**:
   - Only take trades that meet all entry criteria to maintain discipline and avoid false signals.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Stochastic Oscillator (14,3,3)**:
   - Used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.
2. **Average True Range (ATR, 14)**:
   - Used to measure volatility and set stop-loss levels.
3. **Price Action Analysis**:
   - Used to confirm significant price movements and identify key support/resistance levels.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in ranging or mean-reverting markets. Avoid using it during strong trending conditions.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to optimize parameters and ensure robustness.
- Combine with other technical indicators (e.g., RSI, Moving Averages) for additional confirmation if needed.

By following the VoltaicReversal strategy, traders can effectively capitalize on long-term volatility reversals while managing risk through disciplined entry and exit rules.
