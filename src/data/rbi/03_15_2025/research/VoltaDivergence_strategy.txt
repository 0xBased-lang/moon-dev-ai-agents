STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaDivergence strategy is a volatility-based trading system that combines RSI overbought/oversold signals, moving average crossovers, and divergence patterns to identify high-probability entry and exit points. This strategy is designed to capitalize on both trending and mean-reverting market conditions.

Key Components:
1. Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14 period
2. Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) - 50 and 200 periods
3. Price action divergence patterns

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition)
   - 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA (golden cross)
   - Bullish divergence pattern present (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low)

2. Short Entry:
   - RSI crosses below 30 (oversold condition)
   - 50 EMA crosses below 200 EMA (death cross)
   - Bearish divergence pattern present (price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high)

Exit Rules:
1. Long Exit:
   - RSI crosses below 50
   - Price closes below 50 EMA
   - Bearish divergence pattern forms

2. Short Exit:
   - RSI crosses above 50
   - Price closes above 50 EMA
   - Bullish divergence pattern forms

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
2. Stop-loss placement:
   - Long trades: Below recent swing low or 1 ATR below entry
   - Short trades: Above recent swing high or 1 ATR above entry
3. Take-profit levels:
   - Primary target: 1:1 risk-reward ratio
   - Secondary target: 2:1 risk-reward ratio (trailing stop can be used)

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14 period)
2. EMA (50 and 200 periods)
3. ATR (14 period) for stop-loss calculation
4. Price action tools for divergence identification

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in volatile markets with clear trends
- Timeframe: 1-hour charts or higher for better reliability
- Confirm entries with volume spikes for increased probability
- Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods
- Backtest thoroughly before live trading to optimize parameters for specific instruments
