STRATEGY_NAME: CloudConvergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The CloudConvergence strategy is a unique approach that combines Ichimoku Cloud analysis with volume and volatility filters to identify high-probability long entries. The strategy focuses on the convergence of key Ichimoku components and uses volume spikes relative to average true range (ATR) as confirmation signals.

Key Components:
1. Ichimoku Cloud (Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines)
2. Average True Range (ATR) for volatility measurement
3. Volume analysis (relative to ATR)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line) and Kijun-sen (Base Line) to converge near their lower band
2. Confirm that daily volume exceeds 50% of the current ATR value
3. Enter long position when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Set initial stop-loss at 2x ATR below entry price
2. Trail stop using 1.5x ATR as price moves in your favor
3. Consider taking partial profits at 1x ATR and 3x ATR levels

Risk Management:
1. Position size should be calculated based on 2x ATR stop-loss distance
2. Risk no more than 1-2% of account equity per trade
3. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. Ichimoku Cloud (with Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines)
2. Average True Range (14-period recommended)
3. Volume indicator

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets
- Combine with price action confirmation for better accuracy
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on market volatility
- Backtest thoroughly before live implementation

The CloudConvergence strategy offers a systematic approach to trading Ichimoku signals with added volume and volatility filters, making it particularly effective in identifying high-probability setups while maintaining strict risk control.
