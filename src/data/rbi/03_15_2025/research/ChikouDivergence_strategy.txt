STRATEGY_NAME: ChikouDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ChikouDivergence strategy combines Ichimoku Cloud's Chikou Span, RSI, and MACD histogram to identify high-probability divergence setups. This strategy focuses on spotting divergences between price action and the Chikou Span while confirming momentum conditions with RSI and MACD.

Key Components:
1. Chikou Span (Ichimoku Cloud): Analyzes price momentum by comparing current closing prices to historical prices.
2. RSI (14-period): Identifies overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions.
3. MACD Histogram: Detects momentum divergences for exit signals.

Entry Rules:
1. Bullish Entry:
   - Price makes a lower low
   - Chikou Span makes a higher low (bullish divergence)
   - RSI < 30 (oversold condition)
   - Enter long on confirmation candle closing above previous high

2. Bearish Entry:
   - Price makes a higher high
   - Chikou Span makes a lower high (bearish divergence)
   - RSI > 70 (overbought condition)
   - Enter short on confirmation candle closing below previous low

Exit Rules:
1. MACD Histogram Divergence:
   - Exit long when price makes higher high but MACD histogram makes lower high
   - Exit short when price makes lower low but MACD histogram makes higher low

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place stop loss below recent swing low for long trades
   - Place stop loss above recent swing high for short trades

3. Take Profit:
   - Use 2:1 risk-reward ratio based on stop loss distance
   - Consider partial profit taking at 1:1 R:R

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
2. Use position sizing based on stop loss distance
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Maintain proper trade journaling

Required Indicators:
1. Ichimoku Cloud (with Chikou Span)
2. RSI (14-period)
3. MACD (12,26,9) with histogram

Additional Notes:
- Best used on 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets
- Combine with price action confirmation for better accuracy
- Avoid trading during low liquidity periods
- Consider using ATR for dynamic stop loss placement

This strategy combines multiple confirmation signals to increase probability while maintaining clear risk management rules. The unique combination of Chikou Span divergence with RSI and MACD creates a robust framework for identifying high-probability setups.
