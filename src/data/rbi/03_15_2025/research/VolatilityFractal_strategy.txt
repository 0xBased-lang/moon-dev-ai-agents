STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFractal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityFractal strategy is a sophisticated approach designed to predict trend reversals by combining divergence analysis, volume fractals, and volatility measurements. It focuses on identifying high-probability reversal points while managing risk through dynamic exit conditions.

### Key Components:
1. **Divergence Detection**: Uses RSI and MACD to identify potential trend reversals.
2. **Volume Fractal Confirmation**: Confirms reversals using volume fractal patterns.
3. **Volatility Management**: Employs ATR multiples to gauge market uncertainty and adjust exits.
4. **Trend Exhaustion Signals**: Incorporates alternative indicators to detect weakening trends.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Divergence Setup**:
   - Look for bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs while RSI and MACD make lower highs.
   - Look for bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows while RSI and MACD make higher lows.
2. **Volume Fractal Confirmation**:
   - Identify a fractal pattern in volume that aligns with the divergence (e.g., a spike in volume at the reversal point).
3. **Entry Trigger**:
   - Enter a long position on bullish divergence confirmed by volume fractal.
   - Enter a short position on bearish divergence confirmed by volume fractal.

### Exit Rules:
1. **ATR-Based Exit**:
   - Monitor the ATR (Average True Range) for rising volatility.
   - Exit the trade if the ATR exceeds a predefined multiple (e.g., 2x the baseline ATR).
2. **Trend Exhaustion Signals**:
   - Exit if alternative indicators (e.g., overbought/oversold RSI levels or MACD crossover) signal trend exhaustion.
3. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss at a level determined by ATR (e.g., 1.5x ATR from entry).
4. **Take Profit**:
   - Set a take profit level based on recent swing highs/lows or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1).

---

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account balance).
2. **Volatility Adjustments**:
   - Reduce position size during periods of high ATR to account for increased risk.
3. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid overconcentration in a single asset or market.

### Required Indicators:
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
   - Period: 14 (default).
   - Used to identify overbought/oversold conditions and divergences.
2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - Parameters: 12, 26, 9 (default).
   - Used to confirm momentum shifts and divergences.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)**:
   - Period: 14 (default).
   - Used to measure volatility and set stop-loss/take-profit levels.
4. **Volume Fractals**:
   - Identify fractal patterns in volume to confirm reversal signals.

---

### Example Workflow:
1. **Identify Divergence**:
   - Price makes a higher high, but RSI and MACD make lower highs (bearish divergence).
2. **Confirm with Volume Fractal**:
   - A significant volume spike occurs at the reversal point.
3. **Enter Trade**:
   - Short position initiated at the confirmation candle close.
4. **Monitor ATR**:
   - Exit if ATR exceeds 2x the baseline level, indicating rising uncertainty.
5. **Exit on Trend Exhaustion**:
   - Close the trade if MACD crosses back above the signal line or RSI moves out of overbought territory.

The VolatilityFractal strategy is ideal for traders who want to capitalize on trend reversals while managing risk through volatility-based exits and volume confirmation.
