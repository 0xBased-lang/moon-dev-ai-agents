STRATEGY_NAME: RapidReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The RapidReversal strategy is designed to capitalize on oversold conditions with strong momentum shifts, using a combination of RSI, MACD histogram, and ATR for precise entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Identifies oversold conditions
2. MACD Histogram - Detects momentum acceleration
3. ATR (Average True Range) - Sets dynamic profit targets

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for RSI to drop below 20 (oversold condition)
2. Confirm MACD histogram is rising at an accelerated rate (faster than its recent average slope)
3. Enter long position when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Set profit target at 1.5x ATR from entry price
2. Set stop-loss at 0.75x ATR from entry price
3. Exit immediately if RSI crosses above 50 (momentum weakening)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily trades limited to 3
3. No trading during major news events
4. Stop-loss is mandatory for every trade

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14 period)
2. MACD (12,26,9)
3. ATR (14 period)

Optimization Tips:
1. Backtest different ATR multiples for profit targets
2. Experiment with RSI thresholds (15-25 range)
3. Test various MACD settings for optimal momentum detection
4. Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy works best in trending markets and should be avoided during choppy, sideways conditions. Always paper trade new settings before live implementation.
