STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergentPulse strategy combines moving average divergence, RSI divergence, and volume analysis to identify high-probability trading opportunities. It focuses on capturing momentum shifts during overbought conditions while incorporating robust risk management.

### Key Components:
1. **Moving Averages**:
   - 10-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for short-term momentum
   - 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) for long-term trend
   - Divergence between these two averages signals potential trend reversals

2. **RSI Divergence**:
   - 14-period RSI used to identify overbought conditions (above 70)
   - Bullish divergence occurs when price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows

3. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Volume spike confirms the strength of the divergence signal
   - Look for a significant increase in volume compared to the average

4. **ATR-Based Stop Loss**:
   - 14-period Average True Range (ATR) used to set dynamic stop-loss levels
   - Ensures risk is proportional to market volatility

### Entry Rules:
1. **Setup**:
   - Wait for the 10-period EMA to diverge from the 50-period SMA (EMA crosses above SMA)
   - Confirm RSI is in overbought territory (above 70) and shows bullish divergence
   - Observe a significant upward spike in volume

2. **Trigger**:
   - Enter a long position when all three conditions align:
     - EMA/SMA divergence
     - RSI bullish divergence
     - Volume spike

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Exit when price returns to equilibrium (EMA and SMA converge)
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop based on ATR

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Set stop loss at 1.5x the 14-period ATR below the entry price
   - Adjust stop loss dynamically as the trade progresses

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade
   - Use ATR to calculate position size based on stop-loss distance

2. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Only trade during high-volume periods to ensure liquidity
   - Avoid trading during major news events or low-volume sessions

### Required Indicators:
1. **10-period EMA**
2. **50-period SMA**
3. **14-period RSI**
4. **14-period ATR**
5. **Volume Indicator**

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear momentum shifts
- Backtest on multiple timeframes to identify optimal settings
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher accuracy in specific markets

The DivergentPulse strategy is designed to capitalize on momentum reversals with a strong emphasis on risk management, making it suitable for both swing and intraday traders.
