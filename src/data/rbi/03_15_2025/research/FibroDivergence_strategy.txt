STRATEGY_NAME: FibroDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroDivergence strategy combines RSI divergence analysis with Fibonacci retracement levels to identify high-probability trend-following opportunities. This approach focuses on detecting divergences between price action and RSI while confirming key support/resistance levels using Fibonacci retracements.

Key Components:
1. RSI Divergence Detection
2. Fibonacci Retracement Levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)
3. Trend Identification
4. Support/Resistance Confirmation

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14-period default)
2. Fibonacci Retracement Tool
3. Price Action Analysis

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - Price forms a lower low while RSI forms a higher low (bullish divergence)
   - Price retraces to a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%)
   - Price shows rejection or reversal at the Fibonacci level
   - Enter long on confirmation candle closing above the Fibonacci level

2. Short Entry:
   - Price forms a higher high while RSI forms a lower high (bearish divergence)
   - Price retraces to a key Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%)
   - Price shows rejection or reversal at the Fibonacci level
   - Enter short on confirmation candle closing below the Fibonacci level

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit:
   - Use Fibonacci extension levels (127.2%, 161.8%) as initial targets
   - Trail stop using RSI overbought/oversold levels (70/30)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Place stop loss below the most recent swing low (for long) or above the most recent swing high (for short)
   - Alternatively, use 1.5x ATR below/above the entry price

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
2. Use position sizing based on stop loss distance
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Maintain a minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio

Additional Notes:
- Confirm divergence with volume analysis for higher accuracy
- Use higher timeframes (4H/Daily) for more reliable signals
- Combine with trendline breaks for additional confirmation
- Avoid trading in choppy or range-bound markets

This strategy works best in trending markets and requires patience to wait for proper divergence setups at key Fibonacci levels. Proper risk management and discipline are crucial for long-term success.
