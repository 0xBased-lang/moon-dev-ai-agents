STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentCloud

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

The DivergentCloud strategy is a momentum-contrarian approach that capitalizes on the divergence between short-term Bollinger Bands and long-term Ichimoku Cloud price projections. This strategy is designed to identify potential reversals by leveraging the interplay between short-term volatility and long-term trend dynamics.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands (Short-Term):**
   - Period: 20
   - Standard Deviation: 2
   - Used to gauge short-term volatility and potential overbought/oversold conditions.

2. **Ichimoku Cloud (Long-Term):**
   - Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line): 9
   - Kijun-sen (Base Line): 26
   - Senkou Span A (Leading Span A): 26
   - Senkou Span B (Leading Span B): 52
   - Chikou Span (Lagging Span): 26
   - Provides a comprehensive view of the long-term trend, support/resistance levels, and momentum.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bearish Momentum Entry:**
   - Wait for the price to touch or exceed the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential overbought condition.
   - Simultaneously, ensure that the Ichimoku Cloud (Senkou Span A and B) is bearish (price below the cloud) or transitioning to bearish.
   - Confirm with the Chikou Span (Lagging Span) being below the price action, signaling bearish momentum.
   - Enter a short position when these conditions align.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Bullish Momentum Exit:**
   - Monitor the price as it approaches or crosses the lower Bollinger Band, indicating a potential oversold condition.
   - Check if the Ichimoku Cloud is turning bullish (price above the cloud) or if the Chikou Span crosses above the price action.
   - Exit the short position when these bullish signals are confirmed.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop-Loss:**
   - Set a stop-loss just above the recent swing high for short positions, or below the recent swing low for long positions.
   - Alternatively, use a percentage-based stop-loss (e.g., 1-2% of the account balance).

2. **Position Sizing:**
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the total account balance on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop-loss level to maintain consistent risk exposure.

3. **Take-Profit:**
   - Use a trailing stop or a fixed take-profit level based on recent support/resistance levels.
   - Consider taking partial profits at key Fibonacci levels or when the price reaches the opposite Bollinger Band.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands:**
   - Period: 20
   - Standard Deviation: 2

2. **Ichimoku Cloud:**
   - Tenkan-sen: 9
   - Kijun-sen: 26
   - Senkou Span A: 26
   - Senkou Span B: 52
   - Chikou Span: 26

### Additional Considerations:
- **Timeframe:** This strategy works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily charts) to filter out noise and false signals.
- **Market Conditions:** Ideal for trending or ranging markets with clear momentum shifts. Avoid using during highly volatile or news-driven market conditions.
- **Confirmation:** Consider using additional indicators like RSI or MACD for further confirmation of momentum shifts.

By combining the short-term volatility insights from Bollinger Bands with the long-term trend and momentum analysis from the Ichimoku Cloud, the DivergentCloud strategy aims to provide a robust framework for identifying high-probability reversal opportunities.
