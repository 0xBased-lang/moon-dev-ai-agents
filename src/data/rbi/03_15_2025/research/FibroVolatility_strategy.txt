STRATEGY_NAME: FibroVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroVolatility strategy combines Fibonacci retracement levels with volatility-based exits, focusing on specific market hours and low-volatility conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

---

### **Key Strategy Components**
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: 
   - Use Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) to identify potential support or resistance zones.
   - These levels are drawn from the most recent significant swing high to swing low (or vice versa).

2. **GMT+2 Market Hours**:
   - Trades are only executed during GMT+2 market hours, which may align with specific liquidity or volatility patterns in the chosen market.

3. **Low Volatility Filter**:
   - Use a volatility indicator (e.g., Average True Range - ATR) to confirm low volatility conditions before entering a trade.
   - Low volatility ensures the market is not overly erratic, increasing the likelihood of a successful retracement play.

4. **ATR-Based Exits**:
   - Exit trades when the price moves beyond a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1x, 1.5x, or 2x ATR) from the entry point.
   - This ensures risk is managed dynamically based on current market conditions.

### **Entry Rules**
1. Identify a clear trend and draw Fibonacci retracement levels from the most recent swing high to swing low (or vice versa).
2. Wait for the price to touch a key Fibonacci level (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%).
3. Confirm low volatility using ATR (e.g., ATR value below a predefined threshold).
4. Ensure the trade is executed during GMT+2 market hours.
5. Enter a long position if the price bounces off a support level or a short position if it rejects a resistance level.

---

### **Exit Rules**
1. Set an initial stop-loss at a multiple of the ATR (e.g., 1x ATR) from the entry point.
2. Take profit when the price moves beyond a predefined ATR multiple (e.g., 1.5x or 2x ATR) in the direction of the trade.
3. Exit the trade immediately if the price breaches the stop-loss level.

---

### **Risk Management**
1. **Position Sizing**: 
   - Use a fixed percentage of the trading account (e.g., 1-2%) for each trade to manage risk.
2. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
   - Place the stop-loss at 1x ATR from the entry point to limit downside risk.
3. **Volatility Filter**:
   - Avoid trading during high volatility periods to reduce the risk of false breakouts or erratic price movements.

### **Required Indicators**
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
   - To identify key support and resistance levels.
2. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - To measure volatility and set stop-loss/take-profit levels.
3. **Time Zone Filter**:
   - Ensure trades are executed only during GMT+2 market hours.

---

### **Example Setup**
1. **Scenario**: EUR/USD is in an uptrend, and the price retraces to the 50% Fibonacci level during GMT+2 hours.
2. **Volatility Check**: ATR is below the predefined threshold, indicating low volatility.
3. **Entry**: Enter a long position as the price bounces off the 50% level.
4. **Exit**: Set a stop-loss at 1x ATR below the entry and take profit at 1.5x ATR above the entry.
