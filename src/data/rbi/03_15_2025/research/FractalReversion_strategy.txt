STRATEGY_NAME: FractalReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalReversion strategy is a sophisticated mean-reversion approach that combines StochRSI divergence, VDMA (Variable Dynamic Moving Average) filters, and fractal confirmation to identify high-probability price action setups. This strategy is designed to capitalize on overextended market conditions and reversals, while filtering out false signals using multiple confirmation layers.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **StochRSI Divergence**: 
   - Identifies potential reversals by detecting divergences between price action and the StochRSI oscillator.
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows while StochRSI makes higher lows.
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs while StochRSI makes lower highs.

2. **VDMA Filters**:
   - Uses Variable Dynamic Moving Averages to filter out noise and confirm the trend direction.
   - VDMA acts as a dynamic support/resistance level, ensuring trades align with the broader trend.

3. **Fractal Confirmation**:
   - Fractals are used to confirm key reversal points in price action.
   - A bullish fractal (higher low) or bearish fractal (lower high) must align with the StochRSI divergence and VDMA filter for a valid setup.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Entry**:
   - StochRSI shows a bullish divergence (price lower low, StochRSI higher low).
   - Price is above the VDMA, confirming an uptrend.
   - A bullish fractal (higher low) is present near the divergence point.
   - Enter a long position on a break above the fractal high.

2. **Bearish Entry**:
   - StochRSI shows a bearish divergence (price higher high, StochRSI lower high).
   - Price is below the VDMA, confirming a downtrend.
   - A bearish fractal (lower high) is present near the divergence point.
   - Enter a short position on a break below the fractal low.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).
   - Alternatively, exit when StochRSI reaches overbought (for longs) or oversold (for shorts) levels.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the recent swing high (for shorts).
   - Ensure the stop loss aligns with the fractal confirmation level.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading capital per trade.
   - Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop loss level.

2. **Trade Filtering**:
   - Only take trades where all three components (StochRSI divergence, VDMA filter, and fractal confirmation) align.
   - Avoid trading during high-impact news events or low liquidity periods.

### Required Indicators:
1. **StochRSI**:
   - Settings: 14-period RSI, 14-period Stochastic, 3-period smoothing.
   - Used to identify divergences and overbought/oversold conditions.

2. **VDMA (Variable Dynamic Moving Average)**:
   - Settings: Adaptive period based on market volatility.
   - Acts as a dynamic trend filter.

3. **Fractals**:
   - Default settings (5-candle pattern).
   - Confirms key reversal points in price action.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy performs best in ranging or mildly trending markets.
- Avoid using it in strongly trending markets, as mean-reversion setups may fail.
- Backtest thoroughly on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to ensure robustness.

By combining StochRSI divergence, VDMA filters, and fractal confirmation, the FractalReversion strategy provides a systematic and disciplined approach to trading mean-reversion setups with high accuracy.
