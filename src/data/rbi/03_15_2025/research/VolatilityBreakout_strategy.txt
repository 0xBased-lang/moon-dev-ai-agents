STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityBreakout strategy is designed to capitalize on strong momentum moves during periods of elevated volatility. It combines Bollinger Bands, MACD, and volatility analysis to identify high-probability breakout opportunities.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. MACD (12, 26, 9 settings)
3. Volatility filter (ATR or standard deviation)

Entry Rules:
1. Price must cross above the upper Bollinger Band
2. MACD histogram must be above its signal line (positive momentum)
3. Volatility must be elevated (ATR above its 20-period SMA or standard deviation above a defined threshold)

Exit Rules:
1. Close position when price crosses back below the upper Bollinger Band
2. Close position if MACD histogram crosses below its signal line
3. Close position if volatility drops below the defined threshold

Risk Management:
1. Set stop-loss below the most recent swing low or a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%)
2. Use position sizing based on account risk tolerance
3. Consider trailing stops to lock in profits during strong trends

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. MACD (12,26,9)
3. ATR (14) or Standard Deviation (20) for volatility filter

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets
- Avoid using during low volatility periods
- Consider higher timeframes (1H or above) for better reliability
- Backtest thoroughly to determine optimal volatility thresholds

The VolatilityBreakout strategy combines momentum confirmation with volatility analysis to identify high-probability breakout trades while managing risk through clear exit criteria.
