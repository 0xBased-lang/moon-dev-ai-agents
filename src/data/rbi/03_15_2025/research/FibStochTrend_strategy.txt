STRATEGY_NAME: FibStochTrend

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibStochTrend strategy combines Fibonacci retracement levels with the Stochastic Oscillator to identify high-probability trend-following opportunities. This approach focuses on entering trades during pullbacks within a strong trend, using Fibonacci levels as support/resistance zones and the Stochastic Oscillator to confirm momentum alignment.

### Key Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: Used to identify potential support/resistance zones during pullbacks in a trending market.
2. **Stochastic Oscillator**: Used to confirm momentum alignment with the trend and identify overbought/oversold conditions.
3. **Trend Identification**: Relies on higher timeframes (e.g., daily or 4-hour charts) to determine the primary trend direction.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Identify the Trend**: Use a higher timeframe (e.g., daily chart) to determine the primary trend (uptrend or downtrend).
2. **Draw Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: On the lower timeframe (e.g., 1-hour chart), draw Fibonacci retracement levels from the most recent swing high to swing low (in an uptrend) or swing low to swing high (in a downtrend).
3. **Wait for Pullback**: Look for price to retrace to key Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) within the trend.
4. **Stochastic Confirmation**: 
   - In an **uptrend**, wait for the Stochastic Oscillator to exit the oversold zone (below 20) and cross above 20, indicating bullish momentum.
   - In a **downtrend**, wait for the Stochastic Oscillator to exit the overbought zone (above 80) and cross below 80, indicating bearish momentum.
5. **Entry Signal**: Enter a long trade in an uptrend or a short trade in a downtrend when the above conditions align.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**: Set take-profit levels at the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2% or 161.8%) or at a key resistance/support level.
2. **Stop Loss**: Place the stop loss below the recent swing low (for long trades) or above the recent swing high (for short trades).
3. **Stochastic Overbought/Oversold Exit**: Consider exiting the trade if the Stochastic Oscillator reaches extreme overbought (above 80) or oversold (below 20) levels, depending on the trend direction.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2 or better.
3. **Trailing Stop**: Use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: Available on most trading platforms.
2. **Stochastic Oscillator**: Default settings (14, 3, 3) are typically sufficient.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets. Avoid using it during choppy or sideways market conditions.
- Always confirm the trend direction on a higher timeframe before executing trades on a lower timeframe.
- Combine this strategy with price action confirmation (e.g., candlestick patterns) for higher accuracy.

By following the FibStochTrend strategy, traders can effectively capitalize on pullbacks within strong trends while managing risk through clear entry and exit rules.
