STRATEGY_NAME: FibroOscillator

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FibroOscillator strategy is a trend-following approach that combines Fibonacci retracement levels with oscillator-based signals to identify high-probability entry and exit points. This strategy is designed to capitalize on both trending and retracement phases within a market.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: 
   - Primary levels used: 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.
   - These levels act as potential support/resistance zones during retracements.

2. **Oscillator (RSI or Stochastic)**:
   - RSI (Relative Strength Index) or Stochastic Oscillator is used to confirm overbought/oversold conditions.
   - Default settings: RSI (14-period) or Stochastic (14,3,3).

3. **Trend Identification**:
   - Use a moving average (e.g., 50-period SMA) to determine the overall trend direction.
   - Price above the moving average indicates an uptrend; below indicates a downtrend.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Uptrend Entry**:
   - Wait for price to retrace to a Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) in an uptrend.
   - Confirm with oscillator: RSI should be below 30 (oversold) or Stochastic should be below 20.
   - Enter a long position when price bounces off the Fibonacci level and the oscillator starts rising.

2. **Downtrend Entry**:
   - Wait for price to retrace to a Fibonacci level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) in a downtrend.
   - Confirm with oscillator: RSI should be above 70 (overbought) or Stochastic should be above 80.
   - Enter a short position when price rejects the Fibonacci level and the oscillator starts falling.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Set take profit at the next Fibonacci extension level (e.g., 127.2% or 161.8%).
   - Alternatively, use a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trend continues.

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss just below the Fibonacci level for long trades or above the Fibonacci level for short trades.
   - Use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) or ATR (Average True Range) to determine stop-loss distance.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of the trading account on any single trade.
   - Adjust position size based on stop-loss distance to maintain consistent risk.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Avoid over-concentration in a single asset or market.
   - Spread trades across multiple instruments to reduce risk.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**:
   - Available on most trading platforms.
   - Draw retracement levels from the recent swing high to swing low (or vice versa).

2. **Oscillator (RSI or Stochastic)**:
   - RSI (14-period) or Stochastic (14,3,3) for overbought/oversold confirmation.

3. **Moving Average (50-period SMA)**:
   - Used to identify the overall trend direction.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets. Avoid using it during choppy or sideways conditions.
- Always backtest the strategy on historical data before applying it to live trading.
- Combine with price action confirmation (e.g., candlestick patterns) for higher accuracy.

By following the FibroOscillator strategy, traders can systematically identify high-probability setups while managing risk effectively.
