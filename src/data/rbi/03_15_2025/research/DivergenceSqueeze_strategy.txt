STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DivergenceSqueeze strategy combines MACD divergence analysis with Bollinger Bands volatility thresholds to identify high-probability trading opportunities. It focuses on spotting weakening momentum through MACD divergence and decreasing volume, while using Bollinger Bands to manage exits during periods of excessive volatility.

Key Strategy Components:
1. MACD (12, 26, 9) for momentum analysis
2. Volume indicator for confirmation
3. Bollinger Bands (20, 2) for volatility measurement

Entry Rules:
1. Look for MACD divergence (price making higher highs while MACD makes lower highs, or vice versa)
2. Confirm decreasing volume during the divergence period
3. Enter long position on bullish divergence (price lower lows, MACD higher lows)
4. Enter short position on bearish divergence (price higher highs, MACD lower highs)

Exit Rules:
1. Close position when price touches or exceeds the 2 standard deviation Bollinger Band
2. Alternatively, exit when MACD crosses the signal line in the opposite direction

Risk Management:
1. Set stop-loss at 1.5 times the average true range (ATR) from entry point
2. Risk no more than 1-2% of account capital per trade
3. Use position sizing based on stop-loss distance
4. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. MACD (12, 26, 9)
2. Volume indicator
3. Bollinger Bands (20, 2)
4. ATR (14) for stop-loss calculation

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
- Works well in trending markets with occasional pullbacks
- Combine with fundamental analysis for better context
- Backtest thoroughly before live trading
- Monitor for false signals during low volatility periods

This strategy aims to capture reversals during weakening trends while protecting profits through volatility-based exits. The combination of divergence confirmation and volatility thresholds creates a balanced approach to trend reversal trading.
