STRATEGY_NAME: ReversalRetracement

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ReversalRetracement strategy is designed to capitalize on high-probability reversal signals in trending markets, using a combination of RSI-based reversal patterns, volume confirmation, and precise retracement levels for entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. RSI (14) for identifying overbought/oversold conditions
2. Volume analysis for confirmation of strength
3. Fibonacci retracement levels for precise entry and exit points

Entry Rules:
1. Look for a 3-consecutive-day high-low reversal pattern on the RSI (14):
   - For long positions: RSI must make lower highs and lower lows for 3 consecutive days
   - Price must be in an overall uptrend (higher highs and higher lows)
2. Confirm with above-average volume on the reversal day
3. Enter long position at 38% retracement of the most recent swing high to swing low
4. Place stop-loss below the 50% retracement level

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit when price falls below 26% retracement level
2. Alternatively, exit if RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition)
3. Exit if volume drops significantly below average for 2 consecutive days

Risk Management:
1. Position size should be calculated based on the distance between entry and stop-loss
2. Risk no more than 1-2% of account capital per trade
3. Use trailing stops after price moves in your favor by 1.5x the initial risk

Required Indicators:
1. RSI (14) - for reversal pattern identification
2. Volume indicator - for confirmation of strength
3. Fibonacci retracement tool - for precise entry and exit levels

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets with clear swing highs and lows
- Avoid using during choppy or sideways market conditions
- Combine with higher timeframe analysis for better context
- Optimal timeframes: 4-hour and daily charts for swing trading

The ReversalRetracement strategy provides a systematic approach to trading reversals with clear rules for entry, exit, and risk management, making it suitable for disciplined traders looking to capitalize on trend continuations after pullbacks.
