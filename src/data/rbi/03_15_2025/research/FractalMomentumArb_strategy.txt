STRATEGY_NAME: FractalMomentumArb

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalMomentumArb strategy combines volume-momentum analysis with fractal patterns to identify high-probability arbitrage opportunities in the market. This strategy is designed to capitalize on short-term price inefficiencies by leveraging the interplay between volume spikes, momentum shifts, and fractal-based support/resistance levels.

Key Components:
1. Volume Analysis: Uses volume spikes to confirm momentum shifts and validate potential arbitrage opportunities.
2. Momentum Indicators: Employs a combination of RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to gauge the strength and direction of price movements.
3. Fractal Patterns: Utilizes fractal indicators to identify key support and resistance levels, which serve as potential entry and exit points.

Entry Rules:
1. Look for a volume spike that coincides with a momentum shift (RSI crossing above/below 50 and MACD crossover).
2. Confirm the presence of a fractal pattern (either bullish or bearish) at a key support or resistance level.
3. Enter a long position if the above conditions are met and price breaks above a fractal resistance level.
4. Enter a short position if the above conditions are met and price breaks below a fractal support level.

Exit Rules:
1. Set a take-profit level at the next significant fractal resistance (for long positions) or support (for short positions).
2. Use a trailing stop-loss based on the Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits and minimize risk.
3. Exit the trade if the momentum indicators reverse (RSI crosses back below/above 50 or MACD shows a bearish/bullish crossover).

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on a fixed percentage of the trading capital (e.g., 1-2% per trade).
2. Set a stop-loss order just below the fractal support level (for long positions) or above the fractal resistance level (for short positions).
3. Use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 to ensure profitable trades outweigh losing ones.

Required Indicators:
1. Volume Indicator (e.g., On-Balance Volume or Volume Weighted Average Price)
2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
4. Fractal Indicator (e.g., Bill Williams Fractals)
5. ATR (Average True Range) for trailing stop-loss

This strategy is best suited for short-term trading in liquid markets where volume and momentum play a significant role in price movements. It requires careful monitoring of the indicators and quick execution to capitalize on the identified arbitrage opportunities.
