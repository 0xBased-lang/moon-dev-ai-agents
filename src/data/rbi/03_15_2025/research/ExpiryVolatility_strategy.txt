STRATEGY_NAME: ExpiryVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ExpiryVolatility strategy is designed to capitalize on the unique price behavior of futures contracts that are nearing or past their expiration date. This strategy focuses on identifying contracts with heightened volatility and uses a combination of range analysis and volatility metrics to determine entry points.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Contract Selection**: Focus on futures contracts that are 5 or more days past their expiration date. These contracts often exhibit increased volatility due to the lack of liquidity and the influence of rollover activity.
2. **Volatility Measurement**: Use the Average True Range (ATR) to gauge the contract's typical volatility. Compare this to the daily high-low range to identify significant deviations.
3. **Entry Signal**: Enter a long position when the difference between the daily high-low range and the ATR equals or exceeds 25% of the contract's daily volatility.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Condition**: The futures contract must be 5+ days past its expiration date.
2. **Volatility Check**: Calculate the difference between the daily high-low range and the ATR. This difference must be equal to or greater than 25% of the contract's daily volatility.
3. **Position Size**: Allocate 20% of the portfolio to the long position in the identified contract.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Exit the position when the contract reaches a predefined profit target, such as a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio.
2. **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss at a level that limits the loss to 1% of the portfolio value.
3. **Time-Based Exit**: If the profit target or stop loss is not hit within 5 trading days, exit the position to avoid excessive exposure to post-expiration volatility.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Limit exposure to 20% of the portfolio per trade to manage risk effectively.
2. **Stop Loss**: Use a stop loss to cap potential losses at 1% of the portfolio value.
3. **Diversification**: Avoid concentrating all positions in a single contract or sector to spread risk.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Average True Range (ATR)**: To measure the contract's typical volatility.
2. **Daily High-Low Range**: To identify significant deviations from the norm.
3. **Daily Volatility**: To calculate the 25% threshold for entry signals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Liquidity**: Be cautious of contracts with extremely low liquidity, as this can lead to slippage and difficulty in exiting positions.
- **Rollover Effects**: Monitor the rollover period closely, as this can significantly impact price behavior and volatility.
- **Market Conditions**: This strategy may perform differently in various market conditions, so it's essential to backtest and adapt the approach as needed.

By focusing on the unique volatility patterns of post-expiration futures contracts, the ExpiryVolatility strategy aims to capture significant price movements while managing risk through careful position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms.
