STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricDivergence strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines price action, volatility, and volume analysis to identify high-probability trading opportunities. The strategy focuses on detecting divergences between price movement, ATR-based volatility, and volume strength, providing a unique edge in identifying potential reversals or continuations.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Price Action Analysis: Monitor the direction and strength of price movement.
2. ATR Volatility: Use Average True Range to measure market volatility.
3. Volume Strength: Analyze volume trends to confirm or contradict price action.
4. Divergence Detection: Identify when price action diverges from both ATR and volume indicators.

Required Indicators:
1. Average True Range (ATR) - Default period 14
2. Volume Indicator (e.g., Volume Weighted Moving Average or On-Balance Volume)
3. Price Action Tools (Candlestick patterns, support/resistance levels)

Entry Rules:
1. Look for price making higher highs while:
   - ATR shows decreasing volatility (lower highs)
   - Volume shows decreasing strength (lower highs)
2. Alternatively, look for price making lower lows while:
   - ATR shows increasing volatility (higher lows)
   - Volume shows increasing strength (higher lows)
3. Confirm divergence with at least two consecutive price swings
4. Enter trade in the direction opposite to the divergence (short for bullish divergence, long for bearish divergence)

Exit Rules:
1. Use ATR-based trailing stops:
   - Set initial stop at 1.5x ATR from entry point
   - Adjust stop to 1x ATR when price moves 2x ATR in your favor
   - Tighten stop to 0.5x ATR when price moves 3x ATR in your favor
2. Take profit at 3x ATR from entry point
3. Exit if divergence pattern fails (price continues in original direction)

Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
2. Use position sizing based on ATR:
   - Position size = (Account risk %) / (1.5x ATR in points)
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Implement maximum daily loss limit (e.g., 5% of account)

Additional Considerations:
1. Best suited for 1-hour or 4-hour timeframes
2. Works well in trending markets with clear price swings
3. Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups
4. Backtest thoroughly across different market conditions
5. Consider using multiple timeframes for confirmation

This strategy requires patience and discipline, as divergence patterns may take time to develop. The combination of volatility and volume analysis with price action provides a robust framework for identifying high-probability setups while managing risk effectively.
