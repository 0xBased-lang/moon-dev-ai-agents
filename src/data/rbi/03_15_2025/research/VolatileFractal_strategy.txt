STRATEGY_NAME: VolatileFractal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatileFractal strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines fractal geometry with volatility analysis to identify high-probability trend reversal opportunities. This strategy is particularly effective in markets experiencing elevated volatility, where price patterns tend to form more distinct and reliable fractal structures.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Fractal Identification: The strategy uses fractal indicators to detect geometric price patterns, such as the classic five-bar fractal structure, which often signals potential reversal points.
2. Volatility Filter: A volatility indicator (e.g., ATR or Bollinger Bands) is used to ensure trades are only taken during periods of elevated market volatility, increasing the likelihood of significant price movements.
3. Trend Confirmation: A secondary trend indicator (e.g., EMA or MACD) is used to confirm the overall market direction and filter out false signals.

Entry Rules:
1. Identify a valid fractal pattern (e.g., a five-bar fractal) on the price chart.
2. Confirm that the fractal formation occurs during a period of elevated volatility (e.g., ATR above a specific threshold or price outside Bollinger Bands).
3. Wait for price to break the fractal level in the opposite direction of the prevailing trend.
4. Enter a position in the direction of the breakout, anticipating a trend reversal.

Exit Rules:
1. Set a stop-loss just beyond the opposite fractal level to manage risk.
2. Take profit when price reaches a predefined risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) or when volatility decreases significantly (e.g., ATR drops below a specific threshold).
3. Exit the trade if the fractal pattern fails to confirm (e.g., price returns to the original fractal level).

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the volatility of the instrument, with smaller positions taken during higher volatility periods.
2. Use a fixed percentage risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account equity).
3. Implement a trailing stop to lock in profits as the trade moves in your favor.

Required Indicators:
1. Fractal Indicator (e.g., Bill Williams Fractals)
2. Volatility Indicator (e.g., ATR or Bollinger Bands)
3. Trend Confirmation Indicator (e.g., EMA or MACD)

This strategy requires careful observation of price action and patience to wait for high-quality setups. It is particularly well-suited for traders who specialize in volatility trading and have experience with fractal analysis.
