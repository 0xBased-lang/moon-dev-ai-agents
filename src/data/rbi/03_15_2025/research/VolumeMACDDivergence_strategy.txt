STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeMACD Divergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) with volume analysis to identify high-probability trade entries and exits. The key components are:

1. Key Components:
- MACD (12,26,9) as the primary indicator
- Volume analysis (50% above average volume threshold)
- Divergence detection for exits
- Trend confirmation for short positions

2. Entry Rules:
- Long Entry: 
  1. MACD line crosses above the Signal line
  2. Current volume exceeds 50% of the average volume (use 20-period volume average)
  3. Confirm bullish momentum with price above 200 EMA (optional filter)

- Short Entry:
  1. MACD line crosses below the Signal line
  2. Current volume exceeds 50% of the average volume
  3. Price is in a downtrend (confirmed by lower highs and lower lows)

3. Exit Rules:
- Long Exit:
  1. Bearish MACD divergence forms (price makes higher high while MACD makes lower high)
  2. MACD crosses below Signal line
  3. Stop-loss at recent swing low

- Short Exit:
  1. Bullish MACD divergence forms (price makes lower low while MACD makes higher low)
  2. MACD crosses above Signal line
  3. Stop-loss at recent swing high

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Initial stop-loss at recent swing high/low
- Trailing stop based on MACD signal line cross
- Risk-reward ratio minimum 1:2

5. Required Indicators:
- MACD (12,26,9)
- Volume indicator (20-period average)
- Optional: 200 EMA for trend confirmation

6. Additional Notes:
- Use higher timeframes (4H or Daily) for better signal reliability
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods
- Combine with price action confirmation for better accuracy
- Backtest thoroughly to determine optimal volume threshold for your market

This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets and provides clear entry/exit signals with volume confirmation to filter out false signals. The divergence-based exit helps capture maximum profit potential while managing risk effectively.
