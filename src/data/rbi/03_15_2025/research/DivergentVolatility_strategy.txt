STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentVolatility

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines divergence analysis with volatility-based exits to identify bearish opportunities in the market. It uses MACD and RSI divergences to spot potential reversals and ATR to manage exits during periods of increased volatility.

### Key Components:
1. **MACD Bullish Divergence**: Identifies when price makes lower lows while MACD makes higher lows, signaling potential weakness in the downtrend.
2. **RSI Bearish Divergence**: Confirms bearish momentum when price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs.
3. **ATR Volatility Expansion**: Used as an exit signal when market volatility increases, indicating potential trend continuation or reversal.

### Entry Rules:
1. Wait for a **MACD bullish divergence** (price makes lower lows, MACD makes higher lows).
2. Simultaneously, confirm a **RSI bearish divergence** (price makes higher highs, RSI makes lower highs).
3. Enter a **short position** when both divergence conditions are met.

### Exit Rules:
1. Monitor the **ATR (Average True Range)** for volatility expansion.
2. Exit the trade when ATR increases by a predefined threshold (e.g., 1.5x the average ATR over the last 14 periods).
3. Alternatively, set a trailing stop based on ATR levels to lock in profits during volatile moves.

### Risk Management:
1. Use a **stop-loss** above the recent swing high or based on ATR multiples (e.g., 2x ATR).
2. Position sizing should account for the volatility of the asset, using ATR to determine appropriate risk per trade.
3. Avoid trading during low volatility periods when divergences may be less reliable.

### Required Indicators:
1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: To identify bullish divergences.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: To confirm bearish divergences.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)**: To manage exits during volatility expansion.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending or ranging markets with clear divergence patterns.
- Avoid using it during choppy or sideways markets where divergences may produce false signals.
- Backtest the strategy to determine optimal ATR thresholds and divergence confirmation periods for your specific trading instrument.
