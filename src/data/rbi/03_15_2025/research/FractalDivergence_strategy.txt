STRATEGY_NAME: FractalDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The FractalDivergence strategy combines fractal pattern analysis with RSI divergence to identify high-probability trend-following opportunities. This approach focuses on detecting emerging trends early while filtering out false signals using momentum confirmation.

### Key Components:
1. **Fractal Patterns**: Identifies key support/resistance levels and potential trend reversals
2. **RSI Divergence**: Confirms momentum shifts in alignment with fractal signals
3. **Trend Confirmation**: Uses price action and moving averages to validate the trend direction

### Required Indicators:
1. Fractal Indicator (standard MT4/MT5 or TradingView)
2. RSI (14-period default)
3. 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

### Entry Rules:
1. **Bullish Setup**:
   - Price forms a bullish fractal (higher low pattern)
   - RSI shows bullish divergence (price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low)
   - Price breaks above the fractal resistance level
   - EMA(50) is sloping upward
   - Enter long on close of breakout candle

2. **Bearish Setup**:
   - Price forms a bearish fractal (lower high pattern)
   - RSI shows bearish divergence (price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high)
   - Price breaks below the fractal support level
   - EMA(50) is sloping downward
   - Enter short on close of breakout candle

### Exit Rules:
1. **Take Profit**:
   - Use 2:1 risk-reward ratio
   - Exit at nearest significant support/resistance level
   - Trail stop using fractal levels as price moves in your favor

2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place stop loss below the most recent fractal low (for longs) or above the most recent fractal high (for shorts)
   - Ensure stop loss is at least 1.5x the average true range (ATR) of the last 14 periods

### Risk Management:
1. Risk no more than 1-2% of account balance per trade
2. Use position sizing based on stop loss distance
3. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods
4. Only trade when RSI is between 30-70 (avoid overbought/oversold extremes)

### Additional Notes:
- Best timeframes: 1H, 4H, Daily
- Works well in trending markets, avoid ranging conditions
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation
- Backtest on multiple currency pairs to identify optimal settings

This strategy provides a systematic approach to trend following while incorporating momentum confirmation through RSI divergence and fractal patterns, making it particularly effective in capturing early trend movements with reduced false signals.
