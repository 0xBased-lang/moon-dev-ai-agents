STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaFlow Momentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DeltaFlow Momentum strategy is a sophisticated approach that combines momentum trading with order flow analysis, focusing on bid-ask spread dynamics and cumulative net delta to identify high-probability trading opportunities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - **Order Flow Imbalance**: Monitors the relationship between bid and ask volumes to identify potential momentum shifts.
   - **Bid-Ask Spread Analysis**: Tracks the narrowing or widening of spreads as a key indicator of liquidity and market sentiment.
   - **Cumulative Net Delta**: Uses delta (difference between buying and selling pressure) to scale position sizes dynamically.
   - **Momentum Confirmation**: Ensures trades align with the prevailing momentum direction.

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - **Long Entry**: Buy when:
     - Bid-ask spread is decreasing (indicating improving liquidity and potential upward momentum).
     - Cumulative net delta is positive and increasing (showing strong buying pressure).
     - Price is above a short-term moving average (e.g., 20-period SMA) for momentum confirmation.
   - **Short Entry**: Sell when:
     - Bid-ask spread is increasing (indicating deteriorating liquidity and potential downward momentum).
     - Cumulative net delta is negative and decreasing (showing strong selling pressure).
     - Price is below a short-term moving average for momentum confirmation.

3. **Exit Rules**:
   - **Take Profit**: Exit when:
     - The bid-ask spread reverses direction (e.g., starts widening for long positions or narrowing for short positions).
     - Cumulative net delta shows signs of weakening (e.g., flattening or reversing).
   - **Stop Loss**: Exit when:
     - Price moves against the position by a predefined percentage (e.g., 1-2% of entry price).
     - Cumulative net delta sharply reverses, indicating a potential trend change.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - **Position Sizing**: Scale position sizes based on the strength of cumulative net delta. Larger positions are taken when delta is strongly positive (for longs) or strongly negative (for shorts).
   - **Diversification**: Limit exposure to any single stock or sector to avoid concentration risk.
   - **Volatility Adjustment**: Reduce position sizes during high-volatility periods to account for increased risk.

5. **Required Indicators**:
   - **Bid-Ask Spread Indicator**: Tracks the difference between the best bid and ask prices in real-time.
   - **Cumulative Net Delta**: Calculates the cumulative difference between buying and selling pressure over a specified period.
   - **Moving Average (e.g., 20-period SMA)**: Used for momentum confirmation and trend alignment.
   - **Volume Profile**: Helps identify key support and resistance levels based on historical volume data.

This strategy is ideal for traders who want to capitalize on short- to medium-term momentum shifts while incorporating advanced order flow analysis. It requires access to real-time market data and a robust trading platform capable of tracking bid-ask spreads and cumulative net delta.
