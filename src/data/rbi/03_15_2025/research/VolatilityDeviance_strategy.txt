STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDeviance

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityDeviance strategy is a contrarian approach that leverages the relationship between price, volatility, and momentum to identify high-probability trading opportunities in futures markets. The strategy focuses on short-term (3-6 months) trades and uses a combination of the Deviance Index (DI) and RSI to time entries and exits.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Deviance Index (DI):** Measures the alignment between price trends and volatility. A "contrarian" signal occurs when price and volatility diverge in a way that suggests a potential reversal or continuation of the current trend.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Low RSI values during expansion periods indicate potential buying opportunities.
3. **Futures Contracts:** The strategy trades 2x leveraged futures contracts to amplify returns during identified opportunities.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Contrarian Signal:** Wait for the Deviance Index (DI) to indicate a contrarian trend alignment between the futures contract's price and its volatility.
2. **Low RSI Confirmation:** Ensure the RSI is in a low range (typically below 30) during an expansion period, signaling potential oversold conditions.
3. **Position Size:** Enter a position with 2x leveraged futures contracts to maximize potential gains.

### Exit Rules:
1. **RSI Overbought:** Exit the position when the RSI reaches overbought levels (typically above 70), indicating the market may be due for a pullback.
2. **Deviance Index Reversal:** Exit if the Deviance Index (DI) shows a reversal in the contrarian trend alignment, suggesting the trade setup is no longer valid.
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Close the position after 3-6 months if neither the RSI nor DI signals an exit, to align with the short-term focus.

### Risk Management:
1. **Stop-Loss:** Set a stop-loss at 5-10% below the entry price to limit downside risk.
2. **Position Sizing:** Use 2x leverage cautiously, ensuring the total exposure aligns with your risk tolerance.
3. **Diversification:** Avoid concentrating all capital in a single futures contract. Spread risk across multiple instruments or sectors.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Deviance Index (DI):** Custom indicator to measure the alignment between price and volatility trends.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Standard 14-period RSI to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
3. **Price and Volatility Data:** Historical price and volatility data for the futures contract being traded.

### Additional Notes:
- The strategy works best in markets with clear trends and volatility patterns.
- Backtest the strategy on historical data to validate its effectiveness for specific futures contracts.
- Monitor macroeconomic factors that could impact the futures market, as these may override technical signals.

By combining contrarian signals from the Deviance Index with momentum confirmation from the RSI, the VolatilityDeviance strategy aims to capitalize on short-term mispricings in futures markets while managing risk through disciplined exits and position sizing.
