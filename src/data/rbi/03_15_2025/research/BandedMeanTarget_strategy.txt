STRATEGY_NAME: BandedMeanTarget

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandedMeanTarget strategy is a mean-reversion approach that combines historical price levels with Bollinger Bands for dynamic adjustments. It focuses on identifying key price thresholds relative to historical highs and incorporates volatility-based risk management.

Key Components:
1. Historical High Reference: Uses the stock's all-time high as a benchmark for price levels.
2. Entry Threshold: 75% of historical high acts as the mean-reversion entry point.
3. Exit Threshold: 125% of historical high serves as the profit-taking level.
4. Bollinger Bands: Used for dynamic stop-loss adjustments based on market volatility.

Entry Rules:
- Go long when the stock price reaches 75% of its historical high.
- Confirm entry when the price is above the lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 standard deviations).

Exit Rules:
- Take profit when the price reaches 125% of the historical high.
- Use a trailing stop based on Bollinger Band width:
  - If bands widen (increased volatility), tighten stop to 40% of entry.
  - If bands narrow (decreased volatility), maintain 50% stop.

Risk Management:
- Initial stop-loss at 50% of the entry price level.
- Dynamic stop adjustment based on Bollinger Band width:
  - Wide bands (volatile market): 40% stop
  - Normal bands: 50% stop
  - Narrow bands (stable market): 60% stop
- Position sizing based on distance between entry and stop levels.

Required Indicators:
1. Historical High Price (all-time high)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
3. Percentage Calculator (for 75% and 125% levels)

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest the strategy across different market conditions.
- Adjust percentage levels based on asset volatility.
- Consider implementing a time-based exit for positions that don't reach target levels.
- Monitor Bollinger Band width changes for dynamic risk management.

This strategy combines mean-reversion principles with volatility-based adjustments, making it particularly suitable for range-bound markets with occasional breakouts. The Bollinger Band integration adds a dynamic element to risk management, adapting to changing market conditions.
