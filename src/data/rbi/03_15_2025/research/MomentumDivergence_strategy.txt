STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The MomentumDivergence strategy combines trend-following and momentum-based signals to identify high-probability long entries. It uses a combination of moving averages, RSI, and volume analysis to confirm trade setups.

Key Components:
1. Trend Confirmation: 20-period EMA crossing above 50-period EMA
2. Momentum Filter: 14-day RSI below 70
3. Divergence Signal: RSI-based momentum indicator showing bullish divergence
4. Volume Confirmation: Current volume within 20% of daily average

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for 20-period EMA to cross above 50-period EMA (bullish trend confirmation)
2. Confirm 14-day RSI is below 70 (no overbought conditions)
3. Identify bullish RSI divergence (price making lower lows while RSI makes higher lows)
4. Verify current volume is within 20% of daily average volume
5. Enter long position when all conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Set stop-loss below recent swing low
2. Take profit when:
   - 20-period EMA crosses below 50-period EMA (trend reversal)
   - RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition)
   - Price reaches 2:1 risk-reward ratio

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss placement below recent swing low
3. Trailing stop option: Move stop to breakeven when price reaches 1:1 risk-reward
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account

Required Indicators:
1. 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI)
4. Volume indicator (for average volume calculation)
5. RSI-based momentum divergence indicator

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for trending markets
- Works well on 1-hour to daily timeframes
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Regularly backtest and optimize parameters for specific instruments

This strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum analysis and volume validation, creating a robust framework for identifying potential long opportunities while managing risk effectively.
