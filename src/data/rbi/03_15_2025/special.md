subject: special started

You've seen me going crazy the last few weeks, building out my agent flow to help me with trading. 

I believe to be a great algorithmic trader, you must start with research of trading strategies.

Then after finding some good strategies, you have to backtest to see if they actually work in the past. 

If they do, they're much more likely to work in the future. 

This is my RBI system, research, backtest, and then implement into bots. 

I built an AI agent flow almost a year ago that has just been getting better and better as the models get better. 

And this AI agent flow does the researching and backtesting 24/7. 

It used to be expensive but then DeepSeek and all of these local models were released so now it's pretty much free.

And since St. Patrick's Day is coming up, I wanted to give you a very special discount. 

For St. Patrick's Day, you get $111 off the Boot Camp. 

Where I teach you step-by-step how to automate your trading and you can even see the live event where we built this RBI agent flow so you can have your own.

Join the bootcamp here right now: https://algotradecamp.com

Don't miss your chance to secure $111 off.

costco trade

The other day when I was buying a PlayStation from Costco, my lady asked, what is the return policy for this? 

The Costco clerk said, "Oh you can return it whenever. Costco will take back a half-eaten sandwich."

That made me instant buy the PlayStation. I thought it was the coolest thing ever to have such a strong guarantee. 

So now if you ever buy anything from me, like the Algo Trade Camp, which is actually the only thing I have for sale.. 

Not only do you get $111 off for St. Patrick's Day,

But we have the Costco guarantee. If for any reason you don't absolutely love everything you learned, you get 100% of your money back. No questions asked.

So you don't even have to make a decision. Just grab the $111 off as it won't be here forever. It's just for St. Patrick's Day.

And if you don't absolutely love it, you can get your money back. No questions asked. It's a 90-day, 100% money back guarantee.

free ai for members

It seems like every single week there is a new AI model.

A new AI subscription that we have to subscribe to. 

So what I did for all Algo Trade Camp members is I put all of the top models in Discord for free. 

That means every single member gets free AI and can cancel their subscriptions. 

You have access to Claude & OpenAI, all their top models for 100% free when you are a member of the Algo Trade Camp. 

And not only that, today there's $111 off for St. Patrick's Day.

That deal will be gone soon, so join here: https://algotradecamp.com
