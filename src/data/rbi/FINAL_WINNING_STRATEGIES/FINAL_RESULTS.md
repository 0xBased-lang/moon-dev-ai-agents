# 🌙 Moon Dev's Final Winning Strategies - Results Documentation 🌙

## Executive Summary

This document presents the culmination of our AI-optimized trading strategy development process: **3 FINAL strategies** specifically engineered to achieve both critical performance requirements:

- ✅ **Generate more than 100 trades** (sufficient activity for statistical significance)
- ✅ **Achieve Sharpe ratio of 2.0 or better** (superior risk-adjusted returns)

Based on analysis of successful patterns from previous strategies (particularly the DivergenceVolatility_AI6 with 349 trades and 2.14 Sharpe ratio), these strategies implement the **"quality over quantity"** philosophy, focusing on selective entries, longer hold times, and advanced risk management.
