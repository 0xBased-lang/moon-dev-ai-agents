STRATEGY_NAME: VolCrushBounce

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility compression, funding rate analysis, and Bollinger Band breakouts to identify high-probability short volatility opportunities during market stress conditions.

Key Components:
1. Funding Rate Regime Filter - Only trade when funding rates are abnormally high (indicating crowded longs)
2. Open Interest Collapse - Requires significant OI decrease (suggesting long liquidation)
3. Bollinger Band Breakout - Price must breach lower Bollinger Band (20,2)
4. Mean Reversion Target - 20-period SMA as exit level

Entry Rules:
1. Confirm funding rates are in top 20% of historical range
2. Verify open interest has dropped â‰¥15% from recent peak
3. Wait for price to close below lower Bollinger Band
4. Enter short position on next candle open

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price closes above 20-period SMA
2. Emergency Exit: If price makes new 5-period high
3. Time Exit: Close position after 24 hours if not triggered

Risk Management:
1. Position Size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: 1.5x average true range (14) below entry
3. Max Drawdown: 5% of portfolio per day

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. 20-period Simple Moving Average
3. Funding Rate historical percentile
4. Open Interest change indicator
5. Average True Range (14)

Special Notes:
- Works best in crypto markets with perpetual contracts
- Most effective on 4h-1d timeframes
- Avoid news events that may cause abnormal volatility
- Requires monitoring of liquidation heatmaps for confirmation

This strategy capitalizes on the "volatility crush" effect when overleveraged longs get liquidated, followed by a mechanical bounce as markets revert to mean. The unique combination of funding rates, OI collapse, and Bollinger Bands creates a high-probability setup with clearly defined risk parameters.
