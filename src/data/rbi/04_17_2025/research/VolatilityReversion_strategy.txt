STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversion  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on mean-reversion opportunities in low-volatility environments by combining historical volatility analysis with RSI-based exit signals.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Historical Volatility (HV) Filter:** Uses 10-day HV to identify low-volatility conditions when it drops below its 20-day moving average (MA).  
2. **RSI Exit Signal:** Monitors 5-day RSI for overbought conditions (crossing above 70) to exit positions.  
3. **Mean-Reversion Focus:** Aims to profit from price rebounds after periods of suppressed volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  - 10-day HV crosses **below** its 20-day MA (confirming low volatility).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close the position when:  
  - 5-day RSI crosses **above 70** (indicating overbought conditions).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Optional trailing stop (e.g., 2x the 10-day ATR) to limit downside.  
2. **Position Sizing:** Adjust based on volatility (e.g., larger positions in lower volatility regimes).  
3. **Avoid Overexposure:** Limit trades to assets with clear mean-reverting tendencies (e.g., indices, ETFs).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 10-day Historical Volatility (standard deviation of logarithmic returns).  
2. 20-day Moving Average of 10-day HV.  
3. 5-day RSI (for exit timing).  
4. Optional: ATR for stop-loss placement.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in range-bound or mildly trending markets.  
- Avoid during high-volatility news events or breakouts.  
- Backtest to confirm optimal parameters for specific assets.  

This strategy is ideal for traders seeking to exploit the "calm before the storm" in volatility cycles while using RSI to capture short-term overextensions.
