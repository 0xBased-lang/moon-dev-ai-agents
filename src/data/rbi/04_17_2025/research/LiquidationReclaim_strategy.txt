STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReclaim  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Clusters:** Identifies extreme market conditions where liquidation events exceed 2 standard deviations on an hourly basis, signaling potential exhaustion in the current trend.  
2. **VWAP Reclamation:** Requires price to reclaim the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as confirmation of a potential reversal or continuation.  
3. **TICK Volume Confirmation:** Uses rising TICK volume to validate the strength of the move, ensuring participation and momentum.  
4. **Bollinger Squeeze Breakouts (15-minute):** Utilizes Bollinger Band contractions followed by breakouts on the 15-minute timeframe to time exits.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. Hourly liquidation clusters exceed 2 standard deviations (indicating potential exhaustion).  
  2. Price reclaims VWAP (confirms reversal or continuation).  
  3. Rising TICK volume confirms bullish momentum.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Signal:**  
  1. Bollinger Bands on the 15-minute chart enter a squeeze (bands tighten).  
  2. Price breaks out of the squeeze (either above upper band for long exits or below lower band if adjusting for short trades).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low or below VWAP (whichever is tighter).  
2. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
3. **Trailing Stop:** Consider using a trailing stop based on ATR (Average True Range) to lock in profits if the trade moves favorably.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Liquidation Cluster Data** (requires access to liquidation heatmaps or similar metrics).  
2. **VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price).  
3. **TICK Volume** (NYSE TICK or equivalent for your market).  
4. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 standard deviations on 15-minute chart).  

**Notes:**  
- This strategy is best suited for volatile markets where liquidation events are frequent.  
- Works well in trending or mean-reverting conditions when combined with proper confirmation.  
- Requires real-time data feeds for liquidation clusters and TICK volume.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Adjust the standard deviation threshold for liquidation clusters based on asset volatility.  
- Test different timeframes for Bollinger Squeeze exits (e.g., 5-minute for scalping, 30-minute for swings).  
- Combine with additional filters like RSI or MACD to avoid false breakouts.
