STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeImpulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The SqueezeImpulse strategy combines Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify volatility compression periods followed by high-probability breakout opportunities confirmed by volume surges. This systematic approach capitalizes on the explosive moves that often follow periods of low volatility.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR multiplier)
3. Volume indicator (with 20-period moving average)
4. Squeeze condition (when Bollinger Bands are inside Keltner Channels)
5. Breakout confirmation (price closing outside bands with above-average volume)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for squeeze condition (Bollinger upper/lower bands inside Keltner Channels)
2. Enter long on first close above upper Bollinger Band when:
   - Volume exceeds 20-period average by 20%
   - Squeeze was present for at least 5 consecutive bars
3. Enter short on first close below lower Bollinger Band when:
   - Volume exceeds 20-period average by 20%
   - Squeeze was present for at least 5 consecutive bars

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - Long: Entry price + (squeeze width at breakout * 1.5)
   - Short: Entry price - (squeeze width at breakout * 1.5)
   (Squeeze width = Keltner upper - Keltner lower band at breakout)
2. Stop Loss:
   - Long: Below the breakout candle low or lower Bollinger Band
   - Short: Above the breakout candle high or upper Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Trade only during high liquidity periods (avoid first/last 30 minutes)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Keltner Channels (20,1.5 ATR)
3. Volume with 20-period MA
4. Custom squeeze detector (optional but recommended)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for 15min-4hr timeframes
2. Works well on indices, commodities, and liquid forex pairs
3. Requires at least 3 months of backtesting for parameter optimization
4. Most effective in trending market conditions

The SqueezeImpulse strategy's unique combination of volatility measurement, volume confirmation, and proportional target setting creates a disciplined approach to trading breakouts from compression periods. The strategy name reflects both the squeeze condition detection and the impulse move that follows the breakout.
