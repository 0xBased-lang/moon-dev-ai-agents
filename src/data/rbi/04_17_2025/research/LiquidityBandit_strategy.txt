STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBandit  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility and potential breakout conditions when the bands narrow significantly.  
2. **Abnormal Volume Spikes:** Detects unusual trading activity that often precedes strong price movements.  
3. **On-Chain Liquidity Shift:** Uses rapid changes in on-chain liquidity levels (e.g., large bid/ask movements or exchange flows) to confirm breakout validity.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract to a predefined threshold (e.g., below 20% of its 20-period average).  
2. Observe a volume spike exceeding 2x the 20-period average volume.  
3. Confirm breakout with a rapid shift in on-chain liquidity (e.g., a sudden increase in exchange net flows or large limit order placements).  
4. Enter long/short on the breakout candle close or the next candle open, depending on the direction of the liquidity shift.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:** Close the position when price reaches the opposite Bollinger Band (for mean reversion) or after a 2:1 risk-reward ratio is achieved.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss just below/above the breakout candleâ€™s low/high or at a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%) beyond the entry point.  
3. **Time-Based Exit:** Exit the trade if no significant follow-through occurs within 3-5 candles.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Limit position size to 1-2% of total capital per trade.  
2. Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods.  
3. Adjust stop-loss levels dynamically if on-chain liquidity shows sudden reversals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations).  
2. Volume indicator (20-period average).  
3. On-chain liquidity metrics (e.g., exchange net flows, order book depth).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines technical compression (Bollinger Bands) with volume anomalies and on-chain liquidity shifts for high-probability breakout trades.
