STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBounce

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band breakouts with order book liquidity analysis to identify high-probability short entries during market stress periods, with a mean-reversion exit condition.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2σ) - Identifies oversold conditions
2. Liquidation Cluster Density - Order book analysis to detect high liquidation zones
3. Keltner Channel (Midline) - Provides mean-reversion exit signal
4. 15-minute timeframe - Balances responsiveness with noise reduction

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to breach the LOWER Bollinger Band (2σ, 20-period)
2. Confirm presence of high liquidation cluster density via order book imbalance:
   - Significant increase in market sell orders
   - Large resting bids being pulled
   - Elevated liquidation heatmap activity
3. Enter short position on confirmation of both conditions

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When price closes ABOVE Keltner Channel midline on 15-minute candle
2. Emergency Exit: If price closes back INSIDE Bollinger Bands (above lower band)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop loss: Initial stop above recent swing high or Bollinger Band midline
3. Time-based exit: Close position if not profitable within 4 hours
4. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Keltner Channel (20,2)
3. Order book imbalance indicator
4. Liquidation heatmap/cluster density tool

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different Bollinger Band periods (14-26) and deviations (1.8-2.2σ)
2. Adjust Keltner Channel parameters for different volatility regimes
3. Fine-tune liquidation cluster thresholds based on asset class

This strategy capitalizes on the combination of technical oversold conditions with order flow confirmation, while using the Keltner Channel as a dynamic exit point to capture mean-reversion moves after liquidation events.
