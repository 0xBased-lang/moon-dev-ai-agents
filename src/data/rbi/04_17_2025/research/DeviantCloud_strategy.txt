STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Funding Rate Extremes:** The strategy identifies overleveraged market conditions by tracking when the 4-hour funding rate exceeds 2 standard deviations above its 30-day average.  
2. **Ichimoku Cloud Confirmation:** A short entry is only triggered if the price simultaneously breaks below the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming bearish momentum.  
3. **Mean Reversion Exit:** Positions are closed when the funding rate returns to its 30-day average, indicating reduced speculative pressure.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short Entry Condition:**  
  - Current 4-hour funding rate > 2 standard deviations above its 30-day average.  
  - Price breaks below the Ichimoku Cloud (Tenkan-Sen/Kijun-Sen or Senkou Span B).  
- **Confirmation:** Wait for the candle to close below the cloud to avoid false breakouts.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking/Exit Condition:**  
  - Funding rate reverts to or below its 30-day average.  
  - Optional: Use a trailing stop or fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2) to secure profits if the mean reversion is slow.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss above the recent swing high or the Ichimoku Cloud top to limit downside.  
3. **Avoid Overexposure:** Do not enter if multiple correlated assets (e.g., BTC and ETH) simultaneously meet the criteria.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Funding Rate Data:** 4-hour funding rate with a 30-day rolling average and standard deviation.  
2. **Ichimoku Cloud:** Tenkan-Sen, Kijun-Sen, Senkou Span A/B for trend confirmation.  

**Notes:**  
- Best suited for high-liquidity crypto perpetual markets (e.g., BTC, ETH).  
- Avoid trading during major news events that may distort funding rates artificially.  
- Backtest to optimize the standard deviation threshold (e.g., 1.5σ vs. 2σ) for different assets.  

This strategy combines mean reversion (funding rate) with trend confirmation (Ichimoku) to exploit overleveraged short-term bearish setups.
