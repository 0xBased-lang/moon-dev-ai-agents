STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaClusterReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated contrarian strategy that capitalizes on market overextensions near liquidation clusters, combining order book analysis with volatility-based exits.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Identification:
   - Uses order book delta imbalance to detect areas of concentrated liquidations
   - Focuses on zones where forced liquidations create temporary price distortions

2. Volatility Measurement:
   - Keltner Channels (20-period EMA with 2.5 ATR bands) for exit signals
   - Statistical thresholds (90th percentile) for entry confirmation

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger Condition:
   - Wait for liquidation density to exceed 90th percentile historical levels
   - Confirm via order book delta showing extreme imbalance (minimum 3:1 ratio)

2. Execution:
   - Enter contrarian position when price reaches identified liquidation cluster
   - Use limit orders at cluster boundaries for better fills

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Close position when price reaches opposite Keltner band (2.5σ)
   - Partial profits at 1.5σ if volatility expands rapidly

2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop placed at 1.5x average liquidation cluster size
   - Trailing stop activates after price moves 1σ in favor

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum 2% risk per trade
   - Adjust size based on cluster density score (higher density = larger position)

2. Volatility Filters:
   - No entries if ATR > 3% of asset price
   - Skip trades during scheduled high-impact news events

Required Indicators:
1. Order Book Delta Imbalance Meter (custom)
2. Liquidation Density Heatmap (90th percentile threshold)
3. Keltner Channels (20EMA, 2.5ATR bands)
4. Average True Range (14-period) for volatility filter

Special Notes:
- Works best in high-liquidity crypto markets
- Requires real-time order book data feed
- Most effective on 15m-4h timeframes
- Combines mean-reversion principles with liquidity-driven entries
