STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility (squeeze) when the BB width falls below historical volatility levels, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Negative Funding Rates:** Acts as a sentiment filter, indicating oversold conditions or excessive short positioning in perpetual futures markets.  
3. **VWAP Anchored to High-Volume Nodes:** Provides dynamic support/resistance levels based on volume-weighted price action, used for exit signals.  
4. **Volatility Expansion Trigger:** Exits trades when volatility expands beyond the squeeze condition, measured against the anchored VWAP.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Trigger when ALL conditions are met:  
  - 4-hour Bollinger Band width (standard deviation % of middle band) contracts below its 20-period historical volatility (e.g., BB width < HV(20)).  
  - Perpetual futures funding rates turn negative (confirming bearish sentiment extremes).  
  - Price is above the anchored VWAP (to avoid counter-trend entries in strong downtrends).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit/Stop Loss:**  
  - **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Close position when the Bollinger Band width expands above its 5-period moving average AND price crosses above/below the anchored VWAP (depending on direction).  
  - **Time-Based Exit:** Auto-exit after 12 candles (48 hours) if no volatility expansion occurs.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade.  
- Stop loss placed at the recent swing low (for longs) or below the anchored VWAP, whichever is tighter.  
- No entries if the 4-hour RSI(14) > 60 (to avoid overbought traps).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + width calculation.  
2. Historical Volatility (20-period).  
3. VWAP anchored to high-volume nodes (e.g., session opens or major swing points).  
4. Funding rate data (exchange API).  
5. Optional: RSI(14) for overbought confirmation.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility cycles (squeeze/expansion) with derivatives market sentiment (funding rates) and volume-based price levels for high-probability mean-reversion entries.
