STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterBands

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of extreme volatility contraction preceding high liquidity events, using a combination of Bollinger Band analysis and liquidation cluster detection.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) - Measures volatility contraction when reaching yearly lows
2. Liquidation Level Heatmap - Identifies high concentration of stop orders
3. Perpetual Funding Rate - Confirms market sentiment shifts

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger: BBW reaches its lowest point in the past 365 days (volatility contraction)
2. Secondary Confirmation: Price approaches a high-density liquidation cluster zone
3. Final Filter: Funding rate begins moving sharply from extreme negative toward neutral

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: When price breaches the nearest identified liquidation level
2. Stop Loss: Opposite side of the volatility contraction range
3. Emergency Exit: Funding rate reverses direction sharply after entry

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on distance to nearest liquidation levels
2. Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
3. No trading during major macroeconomic announcements
4. Time-based exit if expected move doesn't materialize within 3-5 days

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation)
2. Custom BBW calculation (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band
3. Liquidation level heatmap (requires order book data)
4. Perpetual funding rate monitor
5. 1-year volatility percentile ranking

Optimization Notes:
- Best suited for crypto markets (particularly BTC and ETH)
- Timeframe: 4-hour to daily charts
- Requires clean liquidity data from exchanges
- Works best in ranging markets preceding volatility expansions

The strategy exploits the market's tendency for explosive moves after periods of extreme complacency, using liquidation clusters as natural profit targets and funding rate reversals as confirmation of impending volatility.
