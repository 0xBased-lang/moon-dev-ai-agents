STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy specializes in identifying and capitalizing on counter-trend opportunities following extreme liquidation events in the market. The approach combines price action analysis with technical indicators to detect overextended moves and profit from their reversals.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cascade Detection:
   - Look for extreme wicks (at least 3x average candle body size) on 4H candles
   - Must be accompanied by volume spikes (minimum 2x 20-period average volume)

2. Confirmation Tools:
   - RSI Divergence (14-period): Price makes new extreme but RSI fails to confirm
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2): Price touching outer bands indicates potential overextension

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for a 4H candle closing with:
   - Extreme wick (long upper/lower shadow)
   - High volume (minimum 2x average)
2. Confirm with RSI divergence:
   - Bullish: Lower price low with higher RSI low
   - Bearish: Higher price high with lower RSI high
3. Enter on next candle open in counter-trend direction

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Target:
   - Middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
2. Secondary Exit:
   - RSI crossing 50 level (for bullish) or 50 level (for bearish)
3. Emergency Exit:
   - New extreme beyond liquidation candle

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum 2% risk per trade
2. Stop Placement:
   - Below/above the extreme wick (bullish/bearish)
3. Time Filter:
   - Only trade during high liquidity hours (London/NY overlap)

Required Indicators:
1. Volume (with 20-period MA)
2. RSI (14-period)
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets (major forex pairs, BTC, ETH)
- Requires patience (only 1-2 setups per week typically)
- Works best in trending markets (not range-bound conditions)
- Combine with higher timeframe trend analysis for better results
