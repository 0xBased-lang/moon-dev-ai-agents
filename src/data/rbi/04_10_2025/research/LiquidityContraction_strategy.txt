STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityContraction  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Contrarian Positioning:** The strategy takes trades against prevailing market sentiment by identifying high liquidation clusters where forced exits (stop-losses or margin calls) are likely concentrated.  
2. **Liquidation Clusters:** Uses aggregated exchange data to pinpoint price zones with high liquidation activity, indicating potential reversal points due to excessive leverage.  
3. **Volatility Contraction Trigger:** Enters trades only when the 3-day Average True Range (ATR) falls below the 20-day ATR average, signaling a period of compressed volatility before potential expansion.  
4. **Exit Mechanics:** Exits positions when liquidity grabs (sharp price movements triggering stops) occur or when volatility expands (3-day ATR rising above its 20-day average).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Identify high liquidation clusters using order book data or aggregated exchange metrics (e.g., liquidation heatmaps).  
- Wait for volatility contraction: 3-day ATR must be below the 20-day ATR average.  
- Enter a contrarian position (long near liquidation-driven sell clusters, short near buy clusters) when price approaches the high-liquidation zone.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Liquidity Grab Exit:** Close the trade if price sharply reverses into the liquidation zone, indicating stop runs or forced exits.  
- **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Exit when the 3-day ATR crosses above the 20-day ATR average, signaling increased volatility and potential trend continuation.  
- Optional: Use a trailing stop based on recent swing highs/lows to protect profits.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the high volatility nature of liquidation zones (e.g., smaller size or wider stops).  
- Stop-loss placed beyond the liquidation cluster to avoid being caught in false breakouts.  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods where liquidation data may be unreliable.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ATR (Average True Range)** – 3-day and 20-day periods for volatility contraction/expansion signals.  
2. **Liquidation Cluster Data** – Aggregated from exchanges or third-party providers (e.g., liquidation heatmaps, order flow tools).  
3. **Price Action Confirmation** – Candlestick patterns or volume spikes near liquidation zones for additional validation.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in leveraged markets (e.g., crypto, futures) where liquidations are frequent.  
- Requires real-time data feeds for accurate liquidation zone identification.  
- Combines mean-reversion (contrarian) and breakout (volatility expansion) principles.
