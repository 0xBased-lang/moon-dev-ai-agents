STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)**: A momentum indicator that measures the strength of price movement, with values ranging from -100 to +100.  
2. **20-period SMA of CMO**: Used to smooth the CMO and identify momentum shifts.  
3. **Volume Surge Filter**: Requires volume to exceed 2x the 10-day average volume to confirm breakout validity.  
4. **Keltner Channels**: Volatility-based bands used for trailing stop placement, calculated using ATR (Average True Range) to adapt to market conditions.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when:  
  1. CMO crosses **above** its 20-period SMA, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.  
  2. Volume exceeds **2x the 10-day average volume**, confirming strong participation.  
- **Short Entry**: Triggered when:  
  1. CMO crosses **below** its 20-period SMA, indicating weakening momentum.  
  2. Volume exceeds **2x the 10-day average volume**, confirming bearish conviction.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop**:  
  - For long positions, the stop is placed at the **lower Keltner Channel band**, adjusted dynamically as price moves up.  
  - For short positions, the stop is placed at the **upper Keltner Channel band**, adjusted dynamically as price moves down.  
- **Profit Target**: None (pure trailing stop approach).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of capital.  
2. **Stop-Loss Initialization**: Set initial stop at the opposite Keltner band upon entry.  
3. **Avoid Low-Volume Breakouts**: Only trade when volume confirms the move (2x avg volume).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)  
2. 20-period SMA of CMO  
3. Volume (10-day average comparison)  
4. Keltner Channels (typically 20-period EMA + 2x ATR)  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **momentum confirmation (CMO + SMA)** with **volume surge validation** for high-probability breakouts.  
- Uses **Keltner Channels** for adaptive trailing stops instead of fixed percentages, improving risk-adjusted returns.  
- Avoids false breakouts by requiring **both momentum and volume** to align.  

**Best Suited For:**  
- Trending markets (stocks, forex, or crypto with clear momentum shifts).  
- Timeframes: 1H or higher (to reduce noise).  

**Note:** Backtest to optimize CMO period (default 14) and Keltner Channel settings (e.g., ATR multiplier).
