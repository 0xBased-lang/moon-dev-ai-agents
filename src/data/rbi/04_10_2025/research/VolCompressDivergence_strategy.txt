STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompress Divergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on the divergence between two key volatility indicators (VIX and VVIX) during periods of market compression, creating a mean-reversion opportunity in SPX.

Key Components:
1. VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) - measures 30-day expected volatility
2. VVIX (VIX of VIX) - measures volatility of volatility
3. 20-day SMA of VIX - establishes baseline volatility level
4. 5-day SMA of VVIX - identifies short-term volatility compression

Entry Rules:
- Go long SPX when ALL conditions are met:
  1. VIX is above its 20-day SMA (indicating elevated volatility)
  2. VVIX closes below its 5-day SMA (showing compression in volatility expectations)
  3. This divergence suggests potential mean-reversion in SPX

Exit Rules:
- Close SPX position when:
  1. VIX crosses below its 20-day SMA (volatility normalization)
  2. Optional: Consider partial profit-taking if VVIX crosses above its 5-day SMA

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should account for SPX's volatility (consider 1-2% risk per trade)
2. Stop-loss options:
   a) Fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3% below entry)
   b) Volatility-based (e.g., 1.5x ATR)
3. Avoid trading during major economic events that may disrupt volatility patterns

Required Indicators:
1. VIX index (real-time)
2. VVIX index (real-time)
3. 20-day simple moving average of VIX
4. 5-day simple moving average of VVIX
5. (Optional) SPX price chart for visual confirmation

Additional Notes:
- Best applied in range-bound or moderately volatile markets
- Monitor for false signals during strong trending markets
- Works best when combined with price action confirmation near support levels
- Backtest suggests optimal performance in 1-5 day holding periods
