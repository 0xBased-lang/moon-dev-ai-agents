STRATEGY_NAME: BandSqueezeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify high-probability breakout opportunities during periods of low volatility, confirmed by volume spikes, and uses Chande's Volatility Index for dynamic exit management.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Measures price volatility
2. Keltner Channels (20,1.5) - Identifies trend direction
3. Volume Delta - Confirms breakout strength
4. Chande's Volatility Index (CVI) - Manages exits

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract inside Keltner Channels (band squeeze condition)
2. Look for price to break above upper Bollinger Band (bullish) or below lower Bollinger Band (bearish)
3. Confirm breakout with volume delta spike (minimum 2x average volume)
4. Enter long/short on next candle's open after confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Initial stop-loss: Opposite side of breakout candle (long: below low, short: above high)
2. Trail stop using Chande's Volatility Index (CVI):
   - For longs: Exit when CVI crosses below 50
   - For shorts: Exit when CVI crosses above 50
3. Optional profit target: 2x initial risk (measured from entry to stop)

Risk Management:
1. Position size: 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum portfolio risk: 5% at any time
3. Avoid trading during major news events
4. Filter trades with overall market direction (only trade breakouts in direction of higher timeframe trend)

Indicator Settings:
- Bollinger Bands: 20 period, 2 standard deviations
- Keltner Channels: 20 period, 1.5 ATR multiplier
- Volume Delta: Compare to 20-period average
- Chande's Volatility Index: 9-period lookback

Special Notes:
1. Most reliable on 1H-4H timeframes
2. Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends
3. Requires at least 3 candles of band squeeze before breakout
4. Combine with RSI(14) >50 for longs, <50 for shorts for additional confirmation
