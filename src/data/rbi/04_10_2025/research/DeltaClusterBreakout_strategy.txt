STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaClusterBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines order book analysis with momentum confirmation to trade breakouts from high-probability liquidity zones. The approach focuses on clustered liquidation levels identified through delta imbalances, then confirms entries with momentum signals while using dynamic pivot-based trailing stops.

Key Components:
1. Liquidity Clustering Detection - Identifies dense order book levels where stop-loss clusters likely exist through delta imbalance analysis
2. Momentum Confirmation - Uses Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) to validate breakout strength
3. Dynamic Range Management - Adjusts stop placement based on pivot point volatility ranges

Entry Rules:
1. Identify a clustered liquidation level through order book delta analysis (minimum 3:1 delta imbalance ratio)
2. Wait for price to test and break through the identified level
3. Confirm with Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-period) crossing above +50 for long or below -50 for short
4. Enter on retest of broken level or first pullback after breakout

Exit Rules:
1. Initial stop placed at opposite side of the pivot range that contained the breakout
2. Trail stop using dynamic pivot points (daily/weekly) adjusted for volatility
3. Take partial profits at 1.5x initial risk, moving stop to breakeven
4. Full exit when price closes beyond trailing stop or CMO reverses direction (crosses back through zero)

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur
4. Stop distance must be at least 1.5x the average true range (ATR)

Required Indicators:
1. Order Book Delta Imbalance Scanner
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (14-period)
3. Dynamic Pivot Points (with volatility adjustment)
4. Average True Range (14-period) for stop sizing

Special Considerations:
- Works best in high-liquidity markets during active trading hours
- Requires real-time order book data feed
- Most effective on 15m-4h timeframes
- Filter for higher probability setups during London/NY session overlap

This strategy capitalizes on institutional order flow patterns while using momentum to filter false breakouts, with dynamic stops that adapt to changing volatility conditions.
