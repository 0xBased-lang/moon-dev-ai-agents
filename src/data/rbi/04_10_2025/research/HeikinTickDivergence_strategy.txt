STRATEGY_NAME: HeikinTickDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This intraday momentum strategy combines Heikin-Ashi candlestick analysis with TICK volume divergence and order book imbalance signals for precise entries and exits.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Trend Filter: Uses smoothed candlesticks to identify clean trends
2. TICK Volume Divergence: Confirms momentum with volume flow
3. Order Book Imbalance: Detects potential reversals for exits

Entry Rules:
1. Heikin-Ashi must show 3 consecutive same-color candles (green for long, red for short)
2. TICK volume must diverge from price (rising volume with flat/declining price for long entry, falling volume with rising price for short entry)
3. Entry on break of high/low of the 3-candle formation

Exit Rules:
1. Primary exit when order book imbalance shows reversal (bid-ask ratio crosses threshold)
2. Secondary exit on Heikin-Ashi reversal candle (opposite color to position)
3. Emergency exit if TICK volume reverses direction sharply

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss placed at 1.5x average true range (ATR)
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 5%
4. No trading during first/last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (smoothed price action)
2. TICK volume indicator (NYSE TICK or equivalent)
3. Order book imbalance meter (bid/ask volume ratio)
4. ATR (14-period for stop calculation)

Optimization Notes:
1. Best suited for liquid index futures or major forex pairs
2. Ideal timeframes: 5-15 minute charts
3. Requires monitoring during high-volume periods
4. Performance improves with volatility expansion days

The HeikinTickDivergence strategy provides a systematic approach to intraday momentum trading by combining multiple confirmation signals while maintaining strict risk controls.
