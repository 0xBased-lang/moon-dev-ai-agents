STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection:** Uses a 10-day Keltner Channel to identify periods of low volatility (squeeze).  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Requires a surge in trading volume exceeding 2x the 20-day average volume to validate the breakout signal.  
3. **Exit Conditions:** Exits trades either when price reaches Bollinger Band extremes (indicating overextension) or when a 3% trailing stop is triggered.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Signal Generation:** Wait for the Keltner Channel width to contract significantly, indicating a volatility squeeze.  
- **Volume Spike:** Confirm the breakout with a volume spike of at least twice the 20-day average volume.  
- **Directional Bias:** Enter long if the breakout is above the Keltner Channel upper band; enter short if the breakout is below the lower band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking:** Close the position when price touches the outer Bollinger Band (typically set to 2 standard deviations).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Use a 3% trailing stop to protect profits and limit losses. Adjust the stop dynamically as the price moves in favor of the trade.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should be based on the 3% trailing stop to ensure risk per trade is controlled (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channel (10-day):** To detect volatility contractions.  
2. **Volume (20-day average):** To confirm breakout validity.  
3. **Bollinger Bands (20-day, 2 Std Dev):** To identify overbought/oversold extremes for exits.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; may produce false signals in choppy or range-bound conditions.  
- Combine with higher timeframe analysis (e.g., daily/weekly trend) to filter trades.  
- Backtest optimal parameters for the Keltner Channel (e.g., ATR multiplier) and Bollinger Band settings.
