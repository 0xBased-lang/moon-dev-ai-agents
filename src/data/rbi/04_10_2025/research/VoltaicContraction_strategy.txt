STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicContraction  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Entry:** The strategy identifies periods of expanding volatility using the Average True Range (ATR) indicator.  
2. **Volume Confirmation:** Declining volume during volatility expansion serves as a secondary confirmation for short entries.  
3. **Dynamic Exit Conditions:** Exits are triggered when volatility contracts (ATR drops below its shorter-term average) and volume normalizes.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Short Entry Condition:**  
  - ATR (14-period) > 20-day moving average of ATR (indicating expanding volatility).  
  - Volume is below its 20-day moving average (confirming declining participation).  
- **Entry Execution:** Enter a short position when both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Exit Condition:**  
  - ATR (14-period) < 10-day moving average of ATR (indicating contraction in volatility).  
  - Volume crosses above its 20-day moving average (signaling normalization).  
- **Exit Execution:** Close the short position when both exit conditions are satisfied.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:**  
   - Set a stop-loss at 1.5x the current ATR value above the entry price to account for volatility spikes.  
2. **Position Sizing:**  
   - Allocate no more than 2% of capital per trade to limit downside risk.  
3. **Time-Based Exit:**  
   - Exit the trade if it remains open for more than 10 days without meeting exit conditions to avoid prolonged exposure.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR):**  
   - Period: 14 (for volatility measurement).  
   - Additional Calculations: 20-day and 10-day moving averages of ATR.  
2. **Volume:**  
   - 20-day moving average of volume for confirmation.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility expansion (ATR) with volume divergence for high-probability short entries.  
- Uses dual moving averages of ATR (20-day and 10-day) to differentiate between entry and exit volatility regimes.  
- Volume normalization acts as a confirming filter for exits, reducing false signals.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Adjust ATR periods (e.g., 10 vs. 14) based on asset volatility.  
- Test different volume lookback periods (e.g., 15-day vs. 20-day) for smoother confirmation.  
- Consider adding a price-based filter (e.g., short only in downtrends) to improve win rate.  

This strategy is designed for mean-reverting or range-bound markets where volatility contractions often follow expansions. It avoids trending markets by relying on volume confirmation.
