STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 6-month low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Volume Surge Confirmation:** A breakout is only valid if accompanied by a surge in volume above its 30-day average, ensuring strong participation.  
3. **Trend-Following Exit:** Positions are closed when price closes below the 20-period SMA, locking in profits or cutting losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) must be at a 6-month low (indicating extreme contraction).  
- **Condition 2:** Volume must exceed its 30-day moving average (confirming breakout strength).  
- **Action:** Enter long on a breakout above the upper Bollinger Band or short on a breakout below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **For Long Positions:** Close the trade if price closes below the 20-period SMA.  
- **For Short Positions:** Close the trade if price closes above the 20-period SMA.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Set a stop-loss at the opposite Bollinger Band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs) or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%).  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Avoid Overcrowding:** Do not take trades if multiple conflicting signals appear simultaneously.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To measure volatility contraction (BBW = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  
2. **Volume (30-day MA)** – To confirm breakout validity.  
3. **20-period SMA** – For trend-based exit signals.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Best suited for **daily or 4H timeframes** to avoid noise.  
- Works well in **ranging markets transitioning to trends**.  
- Avoid using during **high-impact news events** due to erratic volatility.  

This strategy combines **low-volatility setups with volume confirmation** for high-probability breakouts while using a simple trailing exit to capture trends.
