STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Breakout Focus**: The strategy capitalizes on sudden increases in volatility, indicating potential strong price movements.  
2. **ATR-Based Trigger**: Uses the 5-minute Average True Range (ATR) to detect breakout conditions when it exceeds twice the daily average ATR.  
3. **Volume Confirmation**: Requires volume to spike above the 20-period moving average to validate the breakout, reducing false signals.  
4. **Risk-Reward Management**: Exits are strictly based on a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, ensuring disciplined profit-taking and loss mitigation.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry Triggered When**:  
  1. The 5-minute ATR exceeds **2x the daily average ATR** (calculated over a lookback period, e.g., 14 days).  
  2. Current volume is **above the 20-period moving average of volume** (confirming participation in the move).  
  3. Entry occurs at the **next candle's open** after conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take-Profit**: Set at **2x the initial risk** (e.g., if stop-loss is 10 pips, take-profit is 20 pips).  
- **Stop-Loss**: Placed at a logical level (e.g., below the recent swing low for longs) or a fixed ATR-based distance (e.g., 1x daily ATR).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of the trading capital.  
2. **Stop-Loss Discipline**: Never adjust stop-loss to widen; only to tighten (e.g., trailing stops after partial profits).  
3. **Time Filter**: Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., holidays, overnight sessions) to prevent slippage.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR)**:  
   - 5-minute ATR (for breakout detection).  
   - Daily ATR (for baseline volatility comparison).  
2. **Volume Moving Average**: 20-period MA of volume (for confirmation).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines **volatility expansion** (ATR) with **volume surge** for high-probability breakouts.  
- Strict **1:2 risk-reward** enforces consistency, avoiding emotional exits.  
- Avoids over-trading by requiring dual confirmation (ATR + volume).  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different ATR multipliers (e.g., 1.5x or 2.5x) to adapt to asset-specific volatility.  
- Adjust volume MA period (e.g., 10 or 30) based on the assetâ€™s typical volume patterns.  
- Apply to **high-liquidity assets** (e.g., major forex pairs, large-cap stocks) for reliable execution.  

**Example Trade:**  
- **Condition**: 5-minute ATR = 15 pips, daily ATR = 7 pips (15 > 2x7), volume spikes above 20-period MA.  
- **Action**: Enter long at next open, stop-loss 10 pips below entry, take-profit 20 pips above.  
- **Outcome**: If price hits +20 pips, profit = 2x risk. If stop-loss hits, loss is contained.  

**Note**: This strategy thrives in **trending markets** but may underperform in choppy/low-volatility conditions. Use a volatility filter (e.g., VIX or ADX) to avoid false signals.
