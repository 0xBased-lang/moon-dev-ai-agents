STRATEGY_NAME: VortexContraction

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines the Vortex Indicator's trend detection with Bollinger Band volatility analysis to identify high-probability entries during low volatility periods, with exits triggered by volatility expansion.

Key Components:
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI- lines) - Measures trend direction and strength
2. Bollinger Band Width - Measures volatility contraction/expansion
3. Historical volatility thresholds - Customizable based on asset class

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band width must be below its 20-period moving average (volatility contraction)
2. Secondary Condition: VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish vortex crossover) for long entries OR VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish vortex crossover) for short entries
3. Confirmation: Price must be trading within the Bollinger Bands (not touching outer bands)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit-taking: When Bollinger Band width expands beyond its 20-period moving average by X% (user-defined parameter)
2. Stop-loss: 
   - Long positions: Below recent swing low or when VI- crosses above VI+
   - Short positions: Above recent swing high or when VI+ crosses above VI-
3. Time-based exit: Optional - Close position after N periods if neither profit nor stop is hit

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility-adjusted risk (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade)
2. Dynamic stop placement using recent swing points
3. Volatility filters to avoid trading during high-volatility regimes

Required Indicators:
1. Vortex Indicator (default 14-period recommended)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation recommended as baseline)
3. Bollinger Band Width (calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band)
4. Moving Average of Band Width (20-period SMA recommended)

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust Bollinger Band periods and standard deviations based on asset volatility
2. Fine-tune the volatility expansion threshold (X%) based on backtesting
3. Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy excels in ranging markets with occasional volatility breakouts, using the Vortex Indicator to catch early trend movements while the Bollinger Band analysis ensures favorable risk/reward entries.
