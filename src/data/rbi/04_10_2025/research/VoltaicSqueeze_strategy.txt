STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction:** Uses Bollinger Band width (BBW) to identify periods of low volatility when BBW contracts below a 10-period threshold, signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **Momentum Confirmation:** Volume-Weighted MACD (VW-MACD) histogram surge validates increasing momentum during the squeeze.  
3. **Breakout Trigger:** 2-period Know Sure Thing (KST) crossover confirms the breakout direction for entry.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup Condition:** Bollinger Band width (BBW) must be below its 10-period average, indicating a volatility squeeze.  
2. **Momentum Filter:** VW-MACD histogram must show a significant surge (e.g., >20% increase from prior bar).  
3. **Breakout Signal:** Enter long if the 2-period KST crosses above its signal line (or short if it crosses below).  
4. **Confirmation:** Entry occurs on the next candle's open after all conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Use a trailing stop based on a multiple (e.g., 1.5x) of the recent Average True Range (ATR).  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop placed at the recent swing low (for long) or swing high (for short), or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2%).  
3. **Time Exit:** Exit after a set number of bars (e.g., 10) if no target or stop is hit.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade.  
2. Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  
3. Filter trades to align with higher timeframe trends (e.g., only long if daily trend is bullish).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + BBW (width calculation).  
2. Volume-Weighted MACD (12,26,9).  
3. Know Sure Thing (KST) with a 2-period ROC for fast signals.  
4. Optional: ATR (14) for stop placement.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression, volume-weighted momentum, and a responsive KST crossover to capture explosive breakouts with reduced false signals.
