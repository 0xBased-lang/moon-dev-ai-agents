STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationConvergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Zone Identification:** Uses historical order book data to identify clustered liquidation levels, which act as high-probability zones for price reversals or breakouts.  
2. **Elder Force Index:** A momentum indicator that confirms breakout strength when it crosses zero, signaling a shift in buying/selling pressure.  
3. **Parabolic SAR:** Used for exit signals, indicating when the trend may be reversing.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Breakout Condition:** Price must break into or converge with a pre-identified liquidation zone (clustered order book levels).  
2. **Momentum Confirmation:** The Elder Force Index must cross above zero for long entries or below zero for short entries, confirming the breakout's strength.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Parabolic SAR Reversal:** Exit the trade when the Parabolic SAR dots flip to the opposite side of the price, indicating a potential trend reversal.  
2. **Alternative Exit:** Consider exiting if price moves significantly beyond the liquidation zone without confirmation from the Elder Force Index.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Stop-Loss Placement:** Set stop-loss just beyond the opposite boundary of the liquidation zone to avoid false breakouts.  
2. **Position Sizing:** Adjust position size based on the distance to the stop-loss to maintain consistent risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
3. **Trailing Stop:** Use the Parabolic SAR as a dynamic trailing stop once the trade is in profit.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Clustered Liquidation Levels (Order Book Data):** Identifies high-probability zones for breakouts.  
2. **Elder Force Index:** Confirms momentum shifts (default settings: 13-period EMA).  
3. **Parabolic SAR:** Provides exit signals (default settings: step = 0.02, max = 0.2).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines order book liquidity analysis with momentum confirmation for higher-probability breakouts.  
- Uses Parabolic SAR for disciplined trend-following exits, reducing emotional decision-making.  
- Focuses on "liquidation zones" where price is likely to accelerate due to stop-loss cascades.  

**Best Suited For:**  
- Intraday to swing trading in liquid markets (forex, crypto, futures).  
- Works best in trending or volatile conditions where liquidation zones are frequently tested.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Backtest different timeframes for the Elder Force Index (e.g., 8 vs. 13 periods).  
- Adjust Parabolic SAR sensitivity (step/max) based on asset volatility.  
- Filter trades with additional confluence (e.g., volume spikes, support/resistance levels).
