STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFilteredEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend-following with volatility filtering to identify high-probability trades during favorable market conditions. The key components are:

1. Key Components:
- 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
- 200-period EMA
- VIX (Volatility Index) as a market sentiment filter
- Golden Cross/Death Cross pattern detection

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: 50-EMA must cross ABOVE 200-EMA (Golden Cross)
- Secondary Filter: VIX must be below 15 (low volatility regime)
- Both conditions must be met simultaneously for long entry

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: VIX rises above 20 (indicating increasing volatility)
- Secondary Exit: 50-EMA crosses BELOW 200-EMA (Death Cross)
- Either condition triggers position closure

4. Risk Management:
- Recommended stop-loss at 2-3% below entry price
- Position sizing should account for volatility (smaller positions during higher VIX)
- Avoid trading during earnings season or major news events

5. Required Indicators:
- 50-period EMA (fast moving average)
- 200-period EMA (slow moving average)
- VIX index or equivalent volatility measure
- Price chart for visual confirmation

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best on daily or 4-hour timeframes
- More effective in trending markets than ranging markets
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation
- Backtest suggests better performance in index ETFs than individual stocks

This strategy aims to capture sustained trends while avoiding high-volatility periods that often lead to whipsaws. The VIX filter helps stay out of trades during potentially dangerous market conditions.
