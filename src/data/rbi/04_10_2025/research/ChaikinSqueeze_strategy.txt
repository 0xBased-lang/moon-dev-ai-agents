STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**: A volume-weighted momentum indicator used to confirm bullish/bearish trends.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze**: Identifies low volatility periods when the 20-day bandwidth is less than half of the 14-day Average True Range (ATR).  
3. **Exit Conditions**: Based on either a volatility expansion (2x bandwidth) or a reversal in CMF momentum.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**: Triggered when:  
  - The 3-day CMF crosses **above zero**, indicating bullish money flow.  
  - The Bollinger Band (20,2) bandwidth is **below 0.5 * ATR(14)**, confirming a squeeze.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit/Volatility Exit**: Close the position when the Bollinger Band bandwidth **expands to 2x its squeeze value** (indicating volatility breakout).  
- **Momentum Reversal Exit**: Exit if the 3-day CMF **reverses below zero** within 5 days, signaling weakening bullish momentum.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop Loss**: Consider using a trailing stop (e.g., 1.5x ATR) or a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) below entry.  
- **Position Sizing**: Allocate capital based on volatility (e.g., risk 1% per trade).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF, 3-day)**  
2. **Bollinger Bands (20,2) + Bandwidth Calculation**  
3. **Average True Range (ATR, 14-day)**  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging markets with periodic volatility contractions.  
- Avoid trading during strong trending phases (use ADX > 25 as a filter if needed).  
- Backtest to optimize CMF period (3-day vs. 5-day) and squeeze threshold (0.5x vs. 0.4x ATR).  

This strategy combines **low-volatility squeeze detection** with **volume-confirmed momentum**, offering a systematic way to trade breakouts with defined risk parameters.
