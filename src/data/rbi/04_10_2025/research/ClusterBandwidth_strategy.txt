STRATEGY_NAME: ClusterBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines on-chain liquidation cluster data with technical Bollinger Band analysis
- Focuses on high-probability breakout zones where liquidations are concentrated
- Uses volatility contraction (low Bandwidth) as entry confirmation
- Monitors both volatility expansion and cluster depletion for exits

2. Entry Rules:
- Identify high liquidation clusters using on-chain data (zones with dense stop orders)
- Wait for price to approach these cluster zones (within 1-2% distance)
- Confirm Bollinger Bandwidth is below 0.5 (indicating low volatility)
- Enter long on breakout above cluster high (for buy clusters) or short below cluster low (for sell clusters)

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary exit: When Bollinger Bandwidth expands beyond entry level + 0.3
- Secondary exit: When on-chain data shows >70% of cluster orders executed
- Emergency exit: If price reverses through opposite cluster boundary

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss: Opposite side of the cluster (for longs: below cluster low; for shorts: above cluster high)
- Maximum daily trades: 3 to avoid over-trading during volatile periods
- Avoid trading during major news events when clusters may be invalidated

5. Required Indicators:
- On-chain liquidation cluster heatmap (showing order density)
- Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviation settings)
- Bollinger Bandwidth indicator (BB width divided by middle band)
- Volume profile (to confirm cluster validity)

6. Special Considerations:
- Works best on 4H and daily timeframes
- Most effective on high-liquidity assets (BTC, ETH, major forex pairs)
- Requires real-time on-chain data feed
- Cluster validity should be confirmed by at least 3 independent data sources

This strategy capitalizes on the combination of order flow dynamics (liquidation clusters) and technical confirmation (volatility contraction), creating high-probability breakout trades with clearly defined risk parameters.
