STRATEGY_NAME: FisherVolume Divergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated momentum strategy that combines two powerful technical indicators - the Fisher Transform and a volume-weighted MACD - with dynamic support/resistance analysis for high-probability entries.

Key Components:
1. Fisher Transform Indicator (10-period)
   - Smoothed price transformation that creates Gaussian-like distribution
   - Identifies extreme price movements and potential reversals
2. Volume-Weighted MACD (12,26,9 periods)
   - Standard MACD calculation weighted by volume intensity
   - Divergence detection between price and indicator
3. Dynamic Support/Resistance
   - Auto-adjusting levels based on recent price extremes
   - Calculated using 20-period Donchian channels

Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
1. Fisher Transform crosses above -0.5 from below
2. Volume-MACD shows bullish divergence (higher lows while price makes lower lows)
3. Price breaks above dynamic resistance level
4. All conditions must occur within 3 bars of each other

SHORT ENTRY:
1. Fisher Transform crosses below 0.5 from above
2. Volume-MACD shows bearish divergence (lower highs while price makes higher highs)
3. Price breaks below dynamic support level
4. All conditions must occur within 3 bars of each other

Exit Rules:
- Take Profit: 2:1 reward ratio based on entry volatility (ATR 14)
- Stop Loss: Opposite side of dynamic S/R level
- Time Exit: Close position if no target hit after 10 bars

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
2. Maximum 3 concurrent positions
3. Stop loss always placed first before entry
4. No trading during first/last 30 minutes of session

Required Indicators:
1. Fisher Transform (10 period)
2. Volume-Weighted MACD (12,26,9)
3. Donchian Channel (20 period)
4. Average True Range (14 period)

Optimization Notes:
- Best performs on 30m-4h timeframes
- Works well with liquid assets showing clear trends
- Requires volume confirmation for validity
- Filter with VWAP for additional confirmation

This strategy excels in capturing momentum shifts while using volume confirmation to filter false signals, making it particularly effective in trending markets with clear support/resistance structures.
