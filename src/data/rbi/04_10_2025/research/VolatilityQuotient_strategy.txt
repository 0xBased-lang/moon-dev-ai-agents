STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityQuotient

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility analysis with momentum indicators to identify potential trend reversals in low-volatility conditions. The core premise is that periods of suppressed volatility often precede significant price movements, while the RSI exit helps capture profits before potential reversals.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses 10-day historical volatility (standard deviation of logarithmic returns)
2. Volatility Baseline: 20-day moving average of the 10-day historical volatility
3. Momentum Filter: 5-day RSI for exit signals

Entry Rules:
- Calculate 10-day historical volatility (HV)
- Calculate 20-day moving average of 10-day HV
- Enter long position when:
  * Current 10-day HV crosses below its 20-day moving average
  * Price is above 200-day moving average (optional trend filter)

Exit Rules:
- Close position when:
  * 5-day RSI crosses above 70 (overbought condition)
  * Or when 10-day HV crosses back above its 20-day MA (volatility expansion)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., 1% risk per trade)
2. Stop-loss at recent swing low or X% below entry
3. Optional trailing stop after RSI crosses 60
4. Maximum portfolio exposure limit (e.g., 20%)

Required Indicators:
1. 10-day historical volatility (standard deviation of log returns)
2. 20-day moving average of 10-day HV
3. 5-day RSI (14-period standard calculation)
4. Optional: 200-day moving average for trend filter

Optimization Considerations:
- Adjust HV period (7-14 days) for sensitivity
- Test different RSI periods (3-7 days) for exits
- Experiment with different moving average lengths for HV baseline
- Consider adding volume confirmation for entries

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending phases, and may underperform in sustained high-volatility environments. The combination of volatility contraction detection with momentum-based exits creates a systematic approach to capture early trend movements while managing risk.
