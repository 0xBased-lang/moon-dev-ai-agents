STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFracture

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines order book liquidity analysis with volatility compression patterns to target high-probability liquidation-driven moves. The core premise revolves around identifying and trading through clustered liquidation zones where forced position closures create explosive price movements.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Heatmap Analysis
   - Identifies high-density liquidation zones (both long and short) using order book data
   - Focuses on areas where multiple stop losses cluster together
   - Zones become more significant with higher liquidity concentration

2. Bollinger Band Squeeze Confirmation
   - Uses BB% (Bollinger Band Percentage) to detect volatility compression
   - Requires squeeze condition (BB width < X% of price) before entry
   - Acts as a volatility filter for higher-probability setups

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger:
   - Price must breach a identified liquidation cluster zone
   - Breach must occur with increasing volume (min 20% above average)

2. Secondary Confirmation:
   - Bollinger Band squeeze must be present (BB width < 1.5% of price)
   - RSI(14) between 40-60 (neutral zone) at time of breach
   - Entry only in direction of breach (long above, short below)

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking:
   - Primary target: 1.5x average liquidation zone width
   - Secondary target: Next significant liquidity zone
   - Trail stop after 1R profit achieved

2. Stop Loss:
   - Initial stop: Opposite side of liquidation zone
   - Maximum risk: 1-2% of capital per trade
   - Emergency stop if price re-enters zone against position

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum 2% risk per trade
   - Adjust position size based on zone significance (A/B/C tiers)
   - Reduce size during high volatility periods

2. Trade Filtering:
   - Only trade liquid markets (minimum $50M daily volume)
   - Avoid news events and scheduled announcements
   - Require minimum 3:1 reward/risk ratio

Required Indicators:
1. Liquidation Heatmap (order book analysis tool)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
3. Volume Profile (for zone validation)
4. RSI (14 period)
5. ATR (14 period for volatility context)

Special Notes:
- Works best in crypto and forex markets with deep liquidity
- Most effective on 1H-4H timeframes
- Requires real-time order book data feed
- Backtest with attention to different volatility regimes

This strategy capitalizes on the market's tendency for accelerated moves when hitting concentrated liquidity zones, using volatility compression as a confirming filter to avoid false breakouts. The "fracture" aspect refers to the price breaking through these clustered liquidation levels with follow-through momentum.
