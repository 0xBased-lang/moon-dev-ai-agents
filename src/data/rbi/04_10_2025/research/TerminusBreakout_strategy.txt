STRATEGY_NAME: TerminusBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines VIX term structure analysis with Bollinger Band breakouts on the S&P 500, creating a unique volatility-adaptive trading approach.

Key Components:
1. VIX Term Structure Analysis:
   - Monitors contango (futures > spot) vs. backwardation (futures < spot)
   - Signals market sentiment shifts when the curve flips polarity

2. Bollinger Band Breakout:
   - Uses standard 20-period, 2-standard deviation bands
   - Tracks price exiting upper/lower bands

Entry Rules:
1. Long Entry:
   - When S&P 500 price exits LOWER Bollinger Band
   - AND VIX term structure flips from contango to backwardation
   - (Signals oversold conditions with increasing fear)

2. Short Entry:
   - When S&P 500 price exits UPPER Bollinger Band
   - AND VIX term structure flips from backwardation to contango
   - (Signals overbought conditions with complacency)

Exit Rules:
1. Mean Reversion Exit:
   - Close long positions when price returns to middle Bollinger Band
   - Close short positions when price returns to middle Bollinger Band

2. Emergency Exit:
   - Exit if price reaches opposite band (for longs: upper band, for shorts: lower band)
   - Exit if VIX curve flips polarity again

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - 1-2% risk per trade
   - Adjust position size based on band width (wider bands = smaller position)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Natural stop at opposite Bollinger Band
   - Maximum 3% of account risk per trade

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. VIX spot and front-month futures
3. VIX term structure calculation (futures minus spot)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best during periods of high volatility
- Most effective when VIX is between 15-30
- Avoid extreme volatility regimes (VIX > 40)

Additional Notes:
- Monitor roll dates for VIX futures
- Combine with volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Works on daily or 4-hour timeframes
