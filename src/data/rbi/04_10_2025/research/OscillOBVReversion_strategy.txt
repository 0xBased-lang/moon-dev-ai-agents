STRATEGY_NAME: OscillOBV Reversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This mean-reversion strategy combines Bollinger Bands %B indicator with On-Balance Volume (OBV) divergence to identify high-probability reversal opportunities, using volume-weighted moving averages for precise exits.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands %B (0.8-1.0 for upper band, 0-0.2 for lower band)
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) for divergence detection
3. Short-term (5-8 period) and long-term (20-25 period) volume-weighted moving averages (VWMA)

Entry Rules:
1. For long entries:
   - Price touches or exceeds lower Bollinger Band (%B ≤ 0.2)
   - OBV shows bullish divergence (price making lower lows while OBV makes higher lows)
   - Confirm with positive volume trend (rising VWMA)

2. For short entries:
   - Price touches or exceeds upper Bollinger Band (%B ≥ 0.8)
   - OBV shows bearish divergence (price making higher highs while OBV makes lower highs)
   - Confirm with negative volume trend (falling VWMA)

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions:
   - When short-term VWMA crosses below long-term VWMA
   - Or when price reaches middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)

2. For short positions:
   - When short-term VWMA crosses above long-term VWMA
   - Or when price falls to middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop-loss placement:
   - For longs: 1 ATR below recent swing low
   - For shorts: 1 ATR above recent swing high
3. Profit target: 1.5-2x risk (trailing stop recommended)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with %B calculation
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV)
3. Volume-Weighted Moving Averages (5/8 period and 20/25 period)
4. Average True Range (ATR) for stop placement

Optimization Notes:
- Test different VWMA periods (5/20 vs 8/25) for exit sensitivity
- Adjust %B thresholds (0.15-0.25 for lower, 0.75-0.85 for upper) based on asset volatility
- Consider adding RSI filter (30/70 levels) for additional confirmation

This strategy excels in ranging markets but should be avoided during strong trending periods confirmed by volume. The unique combination of price oscillation signals with volume divergence creates high-probability mean-reversion opportunities.
