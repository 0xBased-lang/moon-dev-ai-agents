STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicCompression  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Detection**: Uses Keltner Channels (typically 20-period EMA with ATR-based bands) to identify periods of narrowing price range, signaling potential breakout opportunities.  
2. **Volume Confirmation**: Relies on TICK volume (NYSE TICK index or similar) to validate breakout strength—entries require a surge in volume to confirm the breakout direction.  
3. **Dynamic Exit Mechanism**: Employs a Chandelier Stop (e.g., 3x ATR trailing from recent high/low) to lock in profits and limit losses, adapting to market volatility.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  1. Keltner Channels narrow (e.g., upper and lower bands contract to within 1.5x ATR of the midline).  
  2. Price breaks above the upper Keltner band.  
  3. TICK volume surges above a threshold (e.g., +800 or 1 standard deviation above its 20-period average).  
- **Short Entry**:  
  1. Keltner Channels narrow (same contraction criteria as above).  
  2. Price breaks below the lower Keltner band.  
  3. TICK volume drops below a threshold (e.g., -800 or 1 standard deviation below its 20-period average).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit-Taking**: Trail Chandelier Stop (e.g., 3x ATR from the highest close since entry for longs, lowest close for shorts).  
- **Stop-Loss**: Initial stop at 2x ATR from entry price if the Chandelier Stop hasn’t yet activated.  
- **Time-Based Exit**: Close position if no follow-through within 3 bars (e.g., price fails to extend beyond the breakout bar’s range).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Risk ≤1% of capital per trade (stop distance determines share size).  
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods (e.g., midday lulls or pre-holiday sessions).  
- Filter out sideways markets by requiring Keltner Channel width to drop below its 20-period median before entry.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Keltner Channels** (20-period EMA, 1.5x ATR band width).  
2. **TICK Volume** (NYSE TICK index or equivalent, with 20-period moving average and standard deviation bands).  
3. **Chandelier Exit** (3x ATR trailing stop).  
4. **ATR (14-period)** for volatility measurement and stop calculations.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility compression (Keltner) with volume-fueled breakouts (TICK), avoiding false signals common in pure price-based systems. The Chandelier Stop ensures adaptive risk control in trending markets.
