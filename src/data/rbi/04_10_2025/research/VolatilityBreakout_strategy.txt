STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction Signal:** Uses the 10-day ATR dropping below its 20-day average to identify periods of reduced volatility, often preceding significant breakouts.  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires price to break the 20-day Donchian Channel high, ensuring the breakout is statistically significant.  
3. **Volume Filter:** Entry is only valid if volume is at least 20% above the average volume, confirming strong participation in the breakout.  
4. **Trailing Exit:** Uses a trailing stop set at 2x the current ATR to lock in profits while allowing for extended trends.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Volatility Condition:** The 10-day ATR must be below its 20-day average (indicating contraction).  
2. **Price Breakout:** Price must close above the 20-day Donchian Channel high.  
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Volume on the breakout day must be at least 20% higher than the average volume (e.g., 50-day moving average of volume).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Trailing Stop:** Exit the trade when price retraces 2x the current ATR from the highest point reached after entry.  
2. **Optional Time Exit:** Consider exiting if no significant follow-through occurs within 5-10 bars to avoid dead capital.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop-Loss:** Initial stop can be set at 1x ATR below entry if a tighter stop is preferred.  
3. **Avoid Overcrowding:** Do not enter if multiple correlated assets are signaling breakouts simultaneously (diversify entries).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **ATR (10-period & 20-period average):** For volatility contraction detection.  
2. **Donchian Channel (20-period high):** For breakout levels.  
3. **Volume (50-period average + 20% threshold):** For confirmation.  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Avoid using during low-liquidity periods or major news events.  
- Backtest across multiple asset classes to confirm robustness.
