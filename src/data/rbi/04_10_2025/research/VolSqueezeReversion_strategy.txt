STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Focuses on volatility contraction/expansion cycles using Bollinger Bands
- Incorporates funding rate dynamics as a sentiment indicator
- Combines technical breakout with mean reversion principles
- Designed for crypto markets where funding rates are significant

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Trigger: Price breaks out of Bollinger Band contraction (bands width at lowest 20% of 30-day range)
- Confirmation: Negative funding rates show significant surge (minimum 2x increase from 7-day average)
- Direction: Trade in the direction of the breakout (long for upper band break, short for lower band break)
- Timing: Enter on first close outside contracted bands with confirming funding rate move

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary Exit: When funding rates revert to mean (return to within 1 standard deviation of 30-day average)
- Secondary Exit: Price retraces to midpoint between Bollinger Bands
- Emergency Exit: If price crosses opposite band (for long: lower band; for short: upper band)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss: 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry point
- Maximum holding period: 72 hours (avoids prolonged exposure to funding rate fluctuations)
- Avoid trading during major macroeconomic events that may distort volatility patterns

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
- Bollinger Band Width indicator (to measure contraction)
- Funding rate data (exchange-specific)
- 30-period simple moving average (for band midpoint)
- Average True Range (14-period for stop calculation)

6. Special Considerations:
- Works best on 4-hour or daily timeframes
- Most effective on high-liquidity crypto pairs with active perpetual contracts
- Requires monitoring of exchange-specific funding rate schedules
- Should be combined with volume analysis to confirm breakout validity

7. Optimization Tips:
- Adjust band period (14-30) based on asset volatility
- Fine-tune funding rate multiplier (1.5x-3x) based on market regime
- Consider adding RSI filter (avoid extreme overbought/oversold conditions)
- Test different mean reversion thresholds for funding rates

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive moves following volatility contraction while using funding rates as both a confirmation and exit signal, creating a balanced approach between momentum and mean reversion principles.
