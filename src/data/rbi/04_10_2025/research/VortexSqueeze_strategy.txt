STRATEGY_NAME: VortexSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Measures trend direction and strength. A bullish signal occurs when VI+ crosses above VI-, indicating potential upward momentum.  
2. **Keltner Channel:** A volatility-based envelope that helps identify "squeeze" conditions when the channel narrows, suggesting reduced volatility and potential breakout opportunities.  
3. **RSI (14-day):** Used to identify overbought conditions (RSI > 70) for exit signals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  - The Keltner Channel is narrowing (indicating a squeeze).  
  - The Vortex Indicator's VI+ line crosses **above** VI-.  
- Confirm the entry with price closing above the Keltner Channel's middle line (EMA) for additional confidence.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Exit the trade when the 14-day RSI exceeds 70 (overbought condition).  
- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop-loss below the recent swing low or below the lower Keltner Channel band to limit downside risk.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with a maximum risk of 1-2% per trade.  
- Avoid entering during high-impact news events that may cause erratic volatility.  
- Monitor the Keltner Channel widthâ€”wider channels may indicate higher volatility and increased risk.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-).  
2. Keltner Channel (default settings: 20-period EMA, 2x ATR width).  
3. RSI (14-period).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy performs best in trending markets after consolidation (squeeze phases).  
- Backtest on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, daily) to validate robustness.  
- Combine with volume analysis to confirm breakout strength.  

**Why "VortexSqueeze"?**  
- "Vortex" highlights the core indicator (VI+/VI- crossover).  
- "Squeeze" reflects the Keltner Channel narrowing, a critical setup for the strategy.  
- The name is unique and avoids generic terms while clearly describing the strategy's mechanics.
