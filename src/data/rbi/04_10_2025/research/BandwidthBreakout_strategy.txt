STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width contracts below a historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile).  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** A breakout is confirmed when price closes outside the Bollinger Band.  
3. **Futures Basis Filter:** The breakout must coincide with a spike in futures basis differentials (contango/backwardation), indicating strong institutional interest.  
4. **Volume Filter:** Volume must exceed the 20-day moving average to confirm participation in the breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter long if:  
  - Bollinger Band width is below its historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile).  
  - Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band.  
  - Futures basis differential spikes (e.g., basis > 0.5% in contango or < -0.5% in backwardation).  
  - Volume exceeds the 20-day moving average.  
- Enter short if:  
  - Bollinger Band width is below its historical percentile.  
  - Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band.  
  - Futures basis differential spikes (same threshold as above).  
  - Volume exceeds the 20-day moving average.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Close the trade when price reverts to the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA).  
- **Stop Loss:** Exit if price closes back inside the Bollinger Band or if volume drops below the 20-day average.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based sizing).  
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital.  
- Avoid trading during major economic events that may distort basis differentials.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
2. Bollinger Band width (BB width = (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band).  
3. 20-day moving average of volume.  
4. Futures basis differential (spot vs. futures price).  

**Notes:**  
- The strategy combines mean-reversion (Bollinger Band contraction) and momentum (breakout).  
- The futures basis filter adds a macro/market-structure layer to avoid false breakouts.  
- Works best in trending markets after consolidation periods.  

This strategy is unique in combining Bollinger Band dynamics with futures basis and volume filters for high-probability breakouts.
