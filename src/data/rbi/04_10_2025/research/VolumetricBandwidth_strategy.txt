STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBandwidth

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction: Measures periods of low volatility (compression) before potential breakouts
2. Volume Confirmation: Requires volume spikes above 50-day average to validate breakouts
3. ATR Trailing Stops: Uses Average True Range for dynamic, volatility-adjusted exit points

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Bandwidth to reach lowest 20% of its 100-day range (extreme contraction)
2. Enter long when price breaks above upper Bollinger Band
3. Confirm with volume spike exceeding 50-day average volume by at least 25%
4. Optional: Require price to close outside bands for confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Initial stop placed at 1.5x ATR(14) below entry price
2. Trailing stop adjusts daily using 2x ATR(14) below highest high since entry
3. Exit entire position when trailing stop is hit
4. Consider partial profit-taking at 2x initial risk level

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated to risk 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum of 3-5 concurrent positions to diversify
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events
4. Filter trades with ADX > 25 to confirm trending conditions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (BB width divided by middle band)
3. 50-day simple moving average of volume
4. ATR (14-period)
5. Optional: ADX (14-period) for trend strength confirmation

Optimization Notes:
1. Test different ATR multiples (1.5-3x) for stop placement
2. Experiment with bandwidth contraction thresholds (15-25% of range)
3. Consider adding time filter (e.g., only trade first 2 hours of session)
4. Backtest different profit-taking ratios (2:1, 3:1)

This strategy combines volatility contraction, volume confirmation, and adaptive exits to capture explosive moves while managing risk through volatility-adjusted position sizing and stops. The VolumetricBandwidth approach is particularly effective in trending markets following periods of consolidation.
