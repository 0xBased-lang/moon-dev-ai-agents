STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility, signaling potential upcoming expansion.  
2. **OBV Divergence:** Detects discrepancies between price action and volume flow, hinting at weakening trends.  
3. **ADX Surge Confirmation:** Ensures the breakout has momentum by requiring a sharp rise in the ADX (e.g., above 25 and increasing).  
4. **Opposing Band Touch Exit:** Uses the opposite Bollinger Band as a profit-taking or stop-loss level.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract significantly (e.g., below a 20-period moving average of the width).  
- Confirm OBV divergence (price makes higher highs while OBV makes lower highs, or vice versa).  
- Enter long/short on a breakout of the Bollinger Band, confirmed by an ADX surge (e.g., ADX rising above 25 with +DI/-DI crossover).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Take profit or exit when price touches the opposite Bollinger Band.  
- Alternatively, exit if OBV reverses direction sharply or ADX starts declining.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stops).  
- Stop-loss placed just outside the breakout band (e.g., middle band for mean reversion fails).  
- Maximum risk per trade capped at 1-2% of capital.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + Band Width  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV)  
3. ADX (14-period) with +DI/-DI lines  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends.  
- Avoid during high ADX (>30) to prevent false breakouts.  
- Combine with higher timeframe trend alignment for better accuracy.  

This strategy captures volatility shifts early while filtering false moves with volume and momentum confirmation.
