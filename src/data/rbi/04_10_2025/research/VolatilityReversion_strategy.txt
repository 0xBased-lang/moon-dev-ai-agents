STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversion  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility-Based Mean Reversion**: This strategy capitalizes on low-volatility conditions, anticipating a reversion to the mean when volatility is at extreme lows.  
2. **ATR Percentile Filter**: Uses the 20-day Average True Range (ATR) to identify periods of unusually low volatility (below the 10th percentile).  
3. **RSI Exit Trigger**: The 5-day RSI acts as an overbought signal to exit positions, ensuring profits are captured before potential reversals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition**: Enter a long position when the 20-day ATR falls below its 10th percentile (calculated over a lookback period, e.g., 100 days).  
- **Confirmation**: Optional: Add a price filter (e.g., closing price above the 50-day SMA) to avoid catching "falling knives."  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Primary Exit**: Close the position when the 5-day RSI crosses above 70, signaling overbought conditions.  
- **Secondary Exit (Optional)**: Implement a trailing stop (e.g., 2x ATR) to protect profits if RSI does not trigger.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Position Sizing**: Use volatility-adjusted sizing (e.g., risk 1% of capital per trade based on ATR).  
- **Stop-Loss**: Set a stop at 1.5x the 20-day ATR below entry to account for potential false breakouts.  
- **Max Drawdown Control**: Limit strategy exposure during prolonged low-volatility regimes (e.g., reduce position size if ATR percentile remains below 10th percentile for >5 days).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Average True Range (ATR)**: 20-day period for volatility measurement.  
2. **RSI**: 5-day period for exit timing.  
3. **Percentile Calculation**: Rolling 100-day window to determine the 10th percentile of ATR.  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines volatility extremes (ATR percentile) with short-term momentum (RSI) for high-probability mean-reversion trades.  
- Avoids choppy markets by focusing on statistically significant low-volatility regimes.  

**Optimization Notes:**  
- Test different percentile thresholds (e.g., 5th or 15th) for ATR.  
- Experiment with RSI periods (3-day vs. 5-day) to fine-tune exits.  
- Backtest across asset classes (stocks, forex) to validate robustness.
