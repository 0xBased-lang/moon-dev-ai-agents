STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** The strategy identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width contracts below a historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile), signaling a potential breakout.  
2. **Volume Profile POC Confirmation:** The strategy requires a prominent Point of Control (POC) in the volume profile, indicating a strong price level where significant trading activity has occurred.  
3. **Volume Surge Entry:** Entries are triggered only when a confirmed surge in volume accompanies the breakout, validating the move.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Setup:**  
   - Bollinger Band width must be below a predefined historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile), indicating contraction.  
   - Volume profile must show a clear and prominent POC near the current price.  
2. **Trigger:**  
   - Price breaks above/below the Bollinger Band (upper/lower) with a surge in volume (e.g., volume > 1.5x the 20-period average).  
   - The breakout candle should close outside the Bollinger Band to confirm the move.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Take Profit:**  
   - Use a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1) based on the initial stop-loss distance.  
   - Alternatively, exit when Bollinger Band width expands significantly (e.g., above the 80th percentile), indicating volatility exhaustion.  
2. **Stop Loss:**  
   - Place stop-loss just below/above the POC level for long/short trades, or inside the Bollinger Band (e.g., mid-band) to filter false breakouts.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position size should be calculated based on the stop-loss distance to limit risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of capital).  
2. Avoid trading during major news events or low-liquidity periods to prevent erratic volume spikes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2):** To measure volatility contraction/expansion.  
2. **Volume Profile:** To identify the Point of Control (POC).  
3. **Volume Moving Average (e.g., 20-period):** To confirm volume surges.  
4. **Historical Percentile Calculator (for Bollinger Band width):** To quantify contraction levels.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- This strategy works best in trending markets after consolidation phases.  
- Backtest to optimize the Bollinger Band width percentile and volume surge multiplier for your specific asset/timeframe.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., rejection wicks at POC) for higher-probability setups.
