STRATEGY_NAME: VolClusterFlip

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This sophisticated volatility trading strategy combines VIX term structure analysis with on-chain liquidity data to identify high-probability short volatility opportunities. The approach focuses on two key market phenomena: VIX term structure flips and clustered liquidity zones.

Key Components:
1. VIX Term Structure Analysis:
   - Monitor daily VIX futures term structure (contango/backwardation)
   - Identify transitions from contango to backwardation
   - Confirm sustained backwardation (minimum 3 consecutive days)

2. On-Chain Liquidity Zones:
   - Analyze blockchain data for significant liquidity clusters
   - Identify high-density resistance levels (top 5% of liquidity zones)
   - Confirm price interaction with these zones (touch or slight breach)

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Trigger:
   - VIX term structure in confirmed backwardation
   - Price touches or slightly breaches identified high-liquidity resistance zone
   - Volume confirmation (above 30-day average)

2. Secondary Confirmation:
   - RSI(14) above 60 (showing overbought conditions)
   - Negative funding rates in perpetual futures markets
   - Open interest increase at resistance level

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Targets:
   - First target: 1.5x average true range (ATR) from entry
   - Second target: Return to contango in VIX term structure
   - Final target: Liquidity zone below current price (next support)

2. Stop Loss:
   - Hard stop: 1x ATR above entry
   - Time stop: 5 days without expected movement
   - Term structure stop: Backwardation deepens beyond 2 standard deviations

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Maximum 2% capital per trade
   - Adjust size based on liquidity zone strength (higher liquidity = larger position)
   - Volatility-adjusted sizing (reduce position if VIX > 30)

2. Portfolio Constraints:
   - Maximum 3 concurrent volatility short positions
   - No new entries when VIX > 35
   - Mandatory 24-hour cooldown after stopped out

Required Indicators:
1. Core Indicators:
   - VIX futures term structure (front month vs second month)
   - On-chain liquidity heatmap (aggregated exchange data)
   - Volume profile (30-day)

2. Confirmation Indicators:
   - RSI (14-period)
   - ATR (14-period)
   - Perpetual futures funding rate
   - Open interest change

3. Monitoring Tools:
   - VIX historical percentile (50-day lookback)
   - Put/Call ratio (for sentiment confirmation)
   - Term structure steepness indicator

Special Considerations:
- Most effective during periods of elevated but declining volatility
- Requires real-time monitoring of VIX futures rolls
- Best applied to major crypto assets with robust on-chain data
- Avoid around major macroeconomic events (FOMC, CPI releases)

This strategy capitalizes on the unique intersection of derivatives market structure and blockchain liquidity patterns, creating a high-edge approach to volatility trading. The VolClusterFlip name reflects both the volatility structure analysis (Flip) and the liquidity cluster component (VolCluster).
