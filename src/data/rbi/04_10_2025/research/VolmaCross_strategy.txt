STRATEGY_NAME: VolmaCross  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **EMA Crossover:** The strategy uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as the primary trend confirmation signal.  
2. **Volatility Filter:** Bollinger Band width (BB width) is used to filter entries during low volatility (BB width < 1) and exits during high volatility (BB width > 2).  
3. **Momentum Indicator:** RSI is used to identify overbought conditions (RSI > 70) as an exit signal.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  - The 50-period EMA crosses **above** the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross).  
  - Bollinger Band width is **below 1** (low volatility).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the **LONG** position when:  
  - RSI exceeds **70** (overbought condition).  
  - Bollinger Band width expands **above 2** (high volatility).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop Loss:** Consider placing a stop loss below the recent swing low or using a fixed percentage (e.g., 2-3%) to limit downside risk.  
- **Position Sizing:** Adjust trade size based on volatility (e.g., smaller positions when BB width is very low).  
- **Avoid Choppy Markets:** Only trade when BB width is below 1 to ensure low volatility before entry.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
2. **200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
3. **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) â€“ For BB width calculation**  
4. **Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period)**  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets but avoids false signals during high volatility.  
- Backtest on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) for robustness.  
- Combine with price action (e.g., support/resistance) for higher accuracy.  

This strategy combines trend-following (EMA crossover) with volatility and momentum filters for disciplined entries and exits.
