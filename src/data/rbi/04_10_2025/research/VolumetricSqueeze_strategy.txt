STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume Surge Filter**: Identifies high-probability breakouts by requiring a 150% increase in 3-day average volume compared to the 30-day median volume.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze**: Uses a 20-period Bollinger Band with 1.5 standard deviations to detect low-volatility conditions (squeeze) preceding potential breakouts.  
3. **Fisher Transform Confirmation**: Adds momentum validation by requiring the Fisher Transform to cross its signal line, ensuring the breakout has directional conviction.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Volume Surge**: The 3-day average volume must exceed 150% of the 30-day median volume.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze**: Price must be within the narrowed Bollinger Bands (20-period, 1.5Ïƒ), indicating a squeeze.  
3. **Fisher Transform Signal**: The Fisher Transform must cross above its signal line for a long entry or below for a short entry.  
4. **Breakout Direction**: Enter long if price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or short if it breaks below the lower band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target**: Use a trailing stop or fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) based on the Bollinger Band width at entry.  
2. **Stop-Loss**: Place below the recent swing low (long) or above the swing high (short), or use the opposite Bollinger Band as a dynamic stop.  
3. **Fisher Transform Reversal**: Exit if the Fisher Transform crosses back below (long) or above (short) its signal line.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing**: Limit risk to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Volatility Adjustment**: Wider Bollinger Bands may require larger stops; adjust position size accordingly.  
3. **Avoid Low-Volume Retests**: Re-entries require reconfirmation of volume surge and Fisher signal.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Volume**: 3-day average and 30-day median.  
2. **Bollinger Bands**: 20-period, 1.5 standard deviations.  
3. **Fisher Transform**: Default settings (typically 9-period).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volume extremes, volatility contraction, and momentum to filter false breakouts, making it distinct from generic Bollinger strategies.
