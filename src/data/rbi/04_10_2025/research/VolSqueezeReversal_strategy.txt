STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy capitalizes on periods of compressed volatility and negative sentiment to enter long volatility positions, exiting when volatility expands beyond a statistically significant threshold.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Measures volatility compression by tracking the difference between upper and lower Bollinger Bands (typically 20-period, 2 StdDev). A 3-month low signals extreme compression.  
2. **Negative Funding Rates:** Indicates bearish sentiment in perpetual futures markets, often preceding short squeezes.  
3. **ATR Spike Exit:** Uses the 90th percentile of historical Average True Range (14-period) to identify excessive volatility expansion for exit timing.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger when both conditions are met:  
  - Bollinger Band Width (BBW) reaches its lowest value in 3 months (63 trading days).  
  - Funding rates are negative (confirming bearish positioning).  
- Enter long volatility via:  
  - Buying ATM options (delta-neutral)  
  - Long futures with tight stop (if directional bias exists)  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close position when:  
  - Current ATR(14) > 90th percentile of its 3-month historical values (pre-calculated threshold).  
  - Optional: Trail stop at 2x the entry-period BBW to capture extended moves.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing: Allocate ≤2% of capital per trade given the high-risk nature of volatility plays.  
- Stop-loss (if used): 1.5x the entry-period BBW to avoid whipsaw exits during initial expansion.  
- Time decay hedge: For options positions, consider offsetting with short-dated OTM options if holding >3 days.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) → Calculate BBW = (Upper Band - Lower Band)/Middle Band  
2. Funding Rates (exchange-specific perpetual swap data)  
3. Average True Range (14-period) + historical percentile calculation  
4. Optional: VWAP to confirm entry/exit timing  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Combines volatility cycles (BBW) with crowd behavior (funding rates) for high-probability mean-reversion.  
- Statistically defined exit removes emotion from profit-taking.  
- Works best in crypto/leveraged markets where funding rate extremes amplify volatility reversals.
