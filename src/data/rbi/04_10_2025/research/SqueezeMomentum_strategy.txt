STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band squeeze detection with ADX trend confirmation to identify high-probability breakout trades. The approach focuses on periods of low volatility (squeeze) followed by expansion with strong trend momentum.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies squeeze conditions when band width contracts
2. ADX (14) - Confirms trend strength when above 25
3. Price action - Breakout direction determines trade bias

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
- Price closes above upper Bollinger Band after a squeeze (band width expansion)
- ADX rises above 25 (confirming trend strength)
- Current ADX+DI > ADX-DI (bullish momentum)

SHORT ENTRY:
- Price closes below lower Bollinger Band after a squeeze (band width expansion)
- ADX rises above 25 (confirming trend strength)
- Current ADX-DI > ADX+DI (bearish momentum)

EXIT RULES:
- Take profit: When price closes back inside Bollinger Bands
- Stop loss: Opposite band (long SL at lower band, short SL at upper band)
- Alternative exit: When ADX falls below 20 (trend weakening)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position size: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placement: Opposite Bollinger Band
3. Trade filter: Only take trades when volatility expansion exceeds recent average
4. Time filter: Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 std dev)
2. ADX (14 periods) with +DI/-DI lines
3. Band width indicator (optional but helpful for squeeze detection)

OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Adjust ADX threshold (20-30) based on market conditions
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals
- Test different timeframes (works best on 1H-4H charts)

This strategy excels in trending markets but may produce false signals during choppy conditions. The combination of volatility contraction (squeeze) followed by expansion with confirmed trend strength creates high-probability trading opportunities.
