STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationBandit  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Cluster Identification:**  
   - Monitor significant drops in open interest (OI) as indicators of forced liquidations.  
   - These clusters often precede strong directional moves due to market imbalance.  

2. **Volume-Weighted Volatility Bands (VWVB):**  
   - Combines volume and volatility to create dynamic bands around price.  
   - Breakouts above/below these bands confirm entry signals.  

3. **Fibonacci Retracement Targets:**  
   - Measure recent swing extremes (highs/lows) to set Fib levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).  
   - Use these as profit-taking zones based on the strength of the breakout.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Trigger Condition:**  
   - Wait for a sharp OI drop (>10-15% within a short timeframe) signaling liquidation.  
   - Price must break outside the VWVB with confirming volume surge.  

2. **Directional Bias:**  
   - Long if breakout occurs above upper VWVB after OI drop in downtrend (short squeeze setup).  
   - Short if breakout occurs below lower VWVB after OI drop in uptrend (long liquidation setup).  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Targets:**  
   - Primary target: 38.2% Fib retracement from recent swing extreme.  
   - Secondary targets: 50% or 61.8% for stronger trends, trailed via VWVB.  

2. **Stop Loss:**  
   - Place stop beyond the opposite VWVB or recent swing low/high (whichever is tighter).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Position size capped at 1-2% risk per trade.  
2. Avoid trading during low-volume periods to prevent false breakouts.  
3. Filter setups with conflicting higher-timeframe structure (e.g., donâ€™t short into a monthly support zone).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Open interest delta (real-time).  
2. Volume-weighted volatility bands (custom indicator combining ATR and volume).  
3. Fibonacci retracement tool (auto-plotted from last 3-5 swings).  

**Unique Edge:**  
Exploits post-liquidation volatility surges with quantified bands and Fib-based reward zones, avoiding arbitrary targets. The VWVB acts as a self-adjusting filter for false breakouts.
