STRATEGY_NAME: ForceSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Elder Force Index (EFI):** Measures the strength behind price movements by combining price changes and volume. A cross above zero signals bullish momentum.  
2. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Indicates low volatility and potential breakout conditions. Calculated as (Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band (SMA).  
3. **Volatility Expansion Exit:** Uses a 10-day average of Bollinger Band width to detect increased volatility, signaling a potential trend exhaustion.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Go **LONG** when:  
  - EFI crosses **above zero** (confirming bullish momentum).  
  - Bollinger Band width is **contracting** (current width < previous width).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Close the position when:  
  - Bollinger Band width **expands beyond its 10-day average** (volatility surge).  
  - Optional: Trail stop-loss using the lower Bollinger Band to lock in profits.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place below the recent swing low or the lower Bollinger Band.  
- **Position Sizing:** Risk â‰¤ 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- **Filter:** Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Elder Force Index (default settings: 13-period EMA).  
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations).  
3. Bollinger Band Width (derived from bands).  
4. 10-day SMA of Bollinger Band width (for exit trigger).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines momentum (EFI) with volatility cycles (Bollinger contraction/expansion) for high-probability breakouts. Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends.  

**Note:** Backtest optimal parameters for EFI period and Bollinger Band settings based on asset class (e.g., 20-period for stocks, 50-period for crypto).
