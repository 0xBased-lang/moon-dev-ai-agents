STRATEGY_NAME: VortexVolumeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VortexVolumeBreakout strategy combines trend confirmation from the Vortex Indicator, volume analysis using Elder's Volume Force, and momentum-based exits via the KST Momentum oscillator. This approach focuses on high-probability breakout trades with clear entry and exit signals.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Vortex Indicator**: Identifies trend direction and potential trend shifts.
2. **Elder's Volume Force**: Confirms breakout strength through volume surges.
3. **KST Momentum Oscillator (3-day EMA)**: Provides exit signals based on momentum reversals.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Trend Confirmation**:
   - Wait for the Vortex Indicator to show a trend shift:
     - VI+ (positive trend) crosses above VI- (negative trend) for a bullish breakout.
     - VI- crosses above VI+ for a bearish breakout.
2. **Volume Surge**:
   - Confirm the breakout with a surge in Elder's Volume Force:
     - Volume Force must be above its 20-period EMA.
     - A sharp increase in volume (e.g., 2x the average volume) strengthens the signal.
3. **Price Action**:
   - Enter the trade when price breaks above a recent high (for bullish trades) or below a recent low (for bearish trades).

### Exit Rules:
1. **Momentum Reversal**:
   - Monitor the 3-day EMA of the KST Momentum oscillator.
   - Exit the trade when the KST EMA reverses direction:
     - For long trades, exit when the KST EMA turns downward.
     - For short trades, exit when the KST EMA turns upward.
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Place a stop loss below the breakout level (for long trades) or above the breakout level (for short trades).
   - Adjust the stop loss to breakeven once the trade moves in your favor by 1.5x the initial risk.

---

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.
2. **Stop Loss**:
   - Set the stop loss based on the volatility of the asset (e.g., 1x ATR or below the breakout level).
3. **Take Profit**:
   - Use a trailing stop or exit based on the KST Momentum reversal.
   - Alternatively, set a risk-reward ratio of at least 2:1.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI)**:
   - VI+ and VI- lines to identify trend direction.
2. **Elder's Volume Force**:
   - Volume Force line and its 20-period EMA for volume confirmation.
3. **KST Momentum Oscillator**:
   - KST line and its 3-day EMA for momentum-based exits.

---

### Example Setup:
1. **Bullish Breakout**:
   - VI+ crosses above VI-.
   - Elder's Volume Force surges above its 20-period EMA.
   - Price breaks above a recent high.
   - Enter long, set stop loss below the breakout level.
   - Exit when the 3-day EMA of KST Momentum turns downward.

2. **Bearish Breakout**:
   - VI- crosses above VI+.
   - Elder's Volume Force surges above its 20-period EMA.
   - Price breaks below a recent low.
   - Enter short, set stop loss above the breakout level.
   - Exit when the 3-day EMA of KST Momentum turns upward.

This strategy is ideal for traders looking to capitalize on high-momentum breakouts with clear confirmation signals and disciplined risk management.
