STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityFade strategy is designed to capitalize on short-term price spikes by fading them when specific technical conditions are met. This strategy combines the ADX indicator, Chaikin Oscillator, ATR trailing stop, and volume profile analysis to identify high-probability mean-reversion opportunities.

### Key Components:
1. **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: Measures the strength of a trend. A value below 20 indicates a weak or non-trending market, which is ideal for fading price spikes.
2. **Chaikin Oscillator**: A momentum indicator that combines price and volume. A cross below zero signals bearish momentum, aligning with the strategy's fade approach.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)**: Used to set a trailing stop at 1.5x the ATR to manage risk and lock in profits.
4. **4-Hour Volume Profile Imbalance Zone**: Confirms exits by identifying areas of significant volume imbalance, which often act as support or resistance levels.

### Entry Rules:
1. Wait for the ADX to fall below 20, indicating a lack of strong trend.
2. Confirm bearish momentum with the Chaikin Oscillator crossing below zero.
3. Enter a short position when both conditions are met, targeting the fade of the short-term price spike.

### Exit Rules:
1. Use a trailing stop set at 1.5x the ATR to protect profits and limit losses.
2. Confirm the exit when price reaches a 4-hour volume profile imbalance zone, which acts as a strong support level for the fade.

### Risk Management:
1. Position sizing should be based on the ATR to ensure risk per trade is within acceptable limits (e.g., 1-2% of account equity).
2. The trailing stop ensures dynamic risk management, adjusting as the trade progresses.
3. Avoid trading during high-impact news events or periods of extreme volatility to reduce false signals.

### Required Indicators:
1. ADX (14-period default setting)
2. Chaikin Oscillator (default settings)
3. ATR (14-period default setting)
4. Volume Profile (4-hour timeframe)

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in ranging or low-volatility markets. Avoid using it during strong trending conditions.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple instruments and timeframes to ensure robustness.
- Combine with fundamental analysis or other technical filters to improve accuracy in specific market conditions. 

The VolatilityFade strategy is a disciplined approach to fading short-term price spikes, leveraging a combination of momentum, volatility, and volume analysis to identify high-probability setups.
