STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricBreakout strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that combines Bollinger Bands, volume analysis, and RSI to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The strategy focuses on capturing strong momentum moves while incorporating volume confirmation to filter out false breakouts.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume analysis (20-day average volume)
3. RSI (14-period)

Entry Rules:
1. Long entry is triggered when:
   - Price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band
   - Current volume exceeds 2x the 20-day average volume
   - RSI is above 50 (confirming bullish momentum)

Exit Rules:
1. Take profit when:
   - RSI crosses below 70 (indicating overbought conditions)
   OR
   - Price closes below the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)

Risk Management:
1. Initial stop-loss placed at:
   - The lower Bollinger Band (for aggressive traders)
   OR
   - 1 ATR below entry price (for conservative traders)
2. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
3. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of account equity

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Volume (20-day average)
3. RSI (14)
4. ATR (14) - optional for stop-loss placement

Additional Considerations:
- Best suited for volatile markets and trending conditions
- Works well on 1-hour to daily timeframes
- Combine with fundamental analysis for higher probability setups
- Avoid trading during low-volume periods or major news events

Optimization Tips:
- Adjust Bollinger Band settings based on market volatility
- Experiment with different volume multipliers (1.5x to 3x)
- Consider adding a moving average filter for trend confirmation
- Test different RSI thresholds for exit conditions

This strategy is particularly effective for capturing strong momentum moves in liquid assets while using volume as a confirmation filter to reduce false breakouts. The combination of volatility, volume, and momentum indicators creates a robust framework for identifying high-probability trading opportunities.
