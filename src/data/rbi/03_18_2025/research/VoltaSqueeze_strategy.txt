STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaSqueeze strategy is a volatility-based breakout system that capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by explosive price movements. It combines Bollinger Bands and Average True Range (ATR) to identify high-probability breakout opportunities and manage risk effectively.

### Key Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)**: Used to identify periods of low volatility (squeeze) and potential breakout levels.
2. **Average True Range (14)**: Used for setting dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels.
3. **20-Day Narrowest Band Condition**: Ensures the strategy only trades during significant volatility contractions.

### Entry Rules:
1. **Volatility Squeeze Condition**: Bollinger Bands must contract to their narrowest point in the last 20 days.
2. **Breakout Confirmation**: Price must close above the upper Bollinger Band.
3. **Entry Trigger**: Enter a long position at the open of the next candle after the breakout confirmation.

### Exit Rules:
1. **Profit Target**: Exit the trade when price reaches a 2x ATR move above the entry price.
2. **Stop-Loss**: Exit the trade if price re-enters the Bollinger Bands (closes below the upper band).
3. **Time-Based Exit**: Consider exiting after 5-10 candles if neither the profit target nor stop-loss is hit, to avoid prolonged sideways movement.

### Risk Management:
1. **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2%) per trade to manage risk.
2. **ATR-Based Stop**: The 2x ATR profit target ensures a favorable risk-reward ratio.
3. **Avoid Overtrading**: Only trade when the volatility squeeze condition is met, ensuring high-quality setups.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)**: To identify volatility contractions and breakout levels.
2. **Average True Range (14)**: To measure volatility and set dynamic exit levels.
3. **Candlestick Chart**: For price action confirmation and trade execution.

### Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in trending markets and may underperform during prolonged consolidation periods.
- Backtest the strategy on multiple timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to identify optimal settings for your trading style.
- Combine with fundamental analysis or other technical filters to improve accuracy in choppy markets.

The VoltaSqueeze strategy is designed to capture explosive moves following periods of low volatility, making it ideal for traders who prefer high-probability, low-frequency setups.
