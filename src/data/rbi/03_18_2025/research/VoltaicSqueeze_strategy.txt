STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VoltaicSqueeze strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by potential breakouts. It combines Bollinger Bands, RSI, and ATR to identify high-probability setups with defined risk parameters.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Measures volatility contraction
2. RSI (14) - Confirms momentum direction
3. ATR (14) - Defines exit levels

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract to their narrowest point in the last 30 days
2. Confirm RSI crosses above 50 level
3. Enter long position when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Set profit target at 2x ATR (14) from entry price
2. Set stop loss at 1x ATR (14) from entry price
3. Exit if RSI crosses below 50 before reaching target

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1% risk per trade
2. Stop loss at 1x ATR ensures controlled risk
3. 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio maintains positive expectancy

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. RSI (14)
3. ATR (14)

Additional Notes:
- Best applied on 1-hour or 4-hour charts for swing trading
- Works well in trending markets
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Combine with volume analysis for additional confirmation
- Backtest on multiple instruments to verify robustness

This strategy aims to capture the initial momentum burst following periods of low volatility, with clearly defined risk parameters and a favorable risk-reward ratio.
