STRATEGY_NAME: VolatileBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatileBreakout strategy combines Bollinger Band width contraction, ADX trend strength, and volume analysis to identify high-probability breakout trades. This strategy is designed to capture strong trending moves following periods of low volatility.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - Identifies periods of contraction and potential breakout levels
2. ADX (14) - Measures trend strength
3. Volume Analysis - Confirms breakout momentum
4. 20-day Volume Average - Provides baseline for volume surge detection

Entry Rules:
1. Bollinger Band Width must be in contraction (narrowing phase)
2. Price must close above the upper Bollinger Band
3. ADX must be above 30, indicating strong trend
4. Volume must surge at least 50% above the 20-day average

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: Close position when price closes below the middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA)
2. Stop Loss: Set at the lower Bollinger Band level
3. Time Exit: Close position if ADX drops below 25, indicating weakening trend

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum portfolio exposure of 5% to any single trade
3. Use trailing stop loss adjusted daily based on Bollinger Bands
4. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. ADX (14)
3. Volume Indicator
4. 20-day Volume Average

Additional Considerations:
