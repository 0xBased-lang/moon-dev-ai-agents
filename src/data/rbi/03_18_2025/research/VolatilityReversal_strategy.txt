STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityReversal strategy is designed to capitalize on breakout opportunities following periods of low volatility, using a combination of Bollinger Bands, Supertrend, and ATR for precise entries and exits.

### Key Strategy Components:
1. **Bollinger Bands Width**: Measures market volatility. The strategy focuses on periods when the Bollinger Bands width is below the historical 10th percentile, indicating a volatility squeeze.
2. **Supertrend**: A trend-following indicator that helps identify the direction of the market. It flips direction when the price crosses above or below the Supertrend line.
3. **ATR (Average True Range)**: Used for setting a trailing stop to manage risk and lock in profits.

### Entry Rules:
- **Long Entry**: 
  - Bollinger Bands width is below the historical 10th percentile (volatility squeeze).
  - Supertrend flips from bearish to bullish (price crosses above the Supertrend line).
- **Short Entry**: 
  - Bollinger Bands width is below the historical 10th percentile (volatility squeeze).
  - Supertrend flips from bullish to bearish (price crosses below the Supertrend line).

### Exit Rules:
- **Long Exit**: 
  - Supertrend flips back to bearish (price crosses below the Supertrend line).
  - OR a 2x ATR trailing stop is triggered (price moves 2x ATR below the highest point since entry).
- **Short Exit**: 
  - Supertrend flips back to bullish (price crosses above the Supertrend line).
  - OR a 2x ATR trailing stop is triggered (price moves 2x ATR above the lowest point since entry).

### Risk Management:
- **Position Sizing**: Use a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%).
- **Stop Loss**: The 2x ATR trailing stop ensures that losses are minimized while allowing room for the trade to develop.
- **Volatility Filter**: Only trade when Bollinger Bands width is below the 10th percentile, ensuring entries are made during low volatility periods with higher breakout potential.

### Required Indicators:
1. **Bollinger Bands**: To measure volatility and identify squeeze conditions.
2. **Supertrend**: To determine trend direction and generate entry/exit signals.
3. **ATR**: To set trailing stops and manage risk.

### Additional Notes:
- **Backtesting**: Ensure the strategy is tested across multiple timeframes and asset classes to confirm its robustness.
- **Optimization**: Adjust the historical percentile for Bollinger Bands width and the ATR multiplier based on market conditions and asset volatility.
- **Timeframe**: Works best on higher timeframes (e.g., 1H, 4H, Daily) to avoid false signals.

This strategy combines volatility analysis with trend-following and risk management, making it suitable for traders looking to exploit breakout opportunities after periods of consolidation.
