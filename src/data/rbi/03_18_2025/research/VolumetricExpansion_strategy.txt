STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricExpansion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolumetricExpansion strategy combines Bollinger Band width analysis with On-Balance Volume (OBV) confirmation to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The strategy focuses on periods of increased volatility and volume expansion, using a trailing stop for dynamic exit management.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Expansion: Measures volatility expansion beyond normal levels
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV): Confirms volume participation in the breakout
3. Average True Range (ATR): Used for dynamic trailing stop placement

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to expand beyond two standard deviations of its 20-period average
2. Confirm with OBV making a new 10-day high
3. Enter long position when both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Use a trailing stop set at 3x the 14-period ATR
2. Trail the stop based on the highest high since entry
3. Exit when price crosses below the trailing stop level

Risk Management:
1. Position size should be calculated based on the distance between entry price and initial stop level
2. Risk no more than 1-2% of account equity per trade
3. Consider implementing a maximum daily loss limit
4. Avoid trading during major news events or low liquidity periods

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width calculation
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV)
3. Average True Range (14)

Additional Considerations:
- Backtest the strategy across different market conditions
- Consider implementing a time-based exit for trades that don't move in your favor
- Monitor overall market context and sector performance
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on market volatility (higher for more volatile markets)

This strategy is particularly effective in trending markets and during periods of increased volatility. The combination of volatility expansion and volume confirmation helps filter out false breakouts, while the ATR-based trailing stop allows for capturing extended moves while protecting profits.
