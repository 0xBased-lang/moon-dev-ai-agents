STRATEGY_NAME: ReversalMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The ReversalMomentum strategy is designed to identify potential trend reversals and capitalize on the early stages of a new trend while avoiding strong trending markets. It combines the use of moving averages for trend identification and the ADX (Average Directional Index) for trend strength analysis.

Key Strategy Components:
1. **50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Used to identify short-term price momentum.
2. **200-period EMA**: Represents the long-term trend and acts as a baseline for trend confirmation.
3. **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: Measures the strength of a trend, helping to filter out strong trending markets and focus on potential reversals.

Entry Rules:
- Enter a **long position** when the 50-period EMA crosses **above** the 200-period EMA (a bullish crossover).
- The ADX must be **below 20** at the time of the crossover, indicating a weak or non-existent trend, which suggests a potential reversal or the beginning of a new trend.

Exit Rules:
- Exit the long position when the ADX rises **above 40**, signaling that the trend has gained significant strength and may be nearing exhaustion or continuation.
- Alternatively, consider exiting if the 50-period EMA crosses **below** the 200-period EMA, indicating a potential trend reversal to the downside.

Risk Management:
- Use a **stop-loss** below a recent swing low or a fixed percentage/point value to limit downside risk.
- Position sizing should be based on account size and risk tolerance, typically risking no more than 1-2% of the account per trade.
- Avoid entering trades during high-impact news events or periods of extreme volatility, as these can lead to false signals.

Required Indicators:
1. **50-period EMA**
2. **200-period EMA**
3. **ADX (14-period default setting is recommended)**

Additional Notes:
- This strategy works best in markets that exhibit cyclical behavior or frequent trend reversals.
- It may underperform in strongly trending markets, as the ADX filter will prevent entries during such conditions.
- Backtesting and optimization of the EMA periods and ADX thresholds are recommended to adapt the strategy to specific markets or timeframes.
