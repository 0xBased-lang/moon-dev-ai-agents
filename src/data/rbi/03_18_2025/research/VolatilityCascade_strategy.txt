STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityCascade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The VolatilityCascade strategy focuses on identifying and capitalizing on volatility expansions that occur after liquidation cascades, using a combination of long/short ratio analysis, Bollinger Bandwidth extremes, and anchored VWAP inflection points.

Key Strategy Components:
1. Liquidation Cascade Detection: Monitor clustered long/short ratio flips to identify potential liquidation cascades. These flips indicate a significant shift in market sentiment and positioning.
2. Bollinger Bandwidth Extremes: Use Bollinger Bandwidth to measure volatility. Enter trades when the bandwidth reaches extreme levels, signaling potential volatility expansions.
3. Anchored VWAP Inflection Points: Use anchored VWAP to identify key support and resistance levels. Exit trades at these inflection points to capture profits and manage risk.

Entry Rules:
1. Detect a liquidation cascade via clustered long/short ratio flips.
2. Confirm volatility expansion by observing Bollinger Bandwidth reaching extreme levels.
3. Enter a trade in the direction of the volatility expansion (long or short) once these conditions are met.

Exit Rules:
1. Monitor the anchored VWAP for inflection points.
2. Exit the trade when the price reaches an anchored VWAP inflection point, signaling a potential reversal or consolidation.

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Adjust position sizes based on the volatility levels indicated by Bollinger Bandwidth. Higher volatility may warrant smaller positions to manage risk.
2. Stop-Loss: Set stop-loss orders at a predefined percentage or price level below the entry point to limit potential losses.
3. Take-Profit: Use anchored VWAP inflection points as take-profit targets to lock in gains.

Required Indicators:
1. Long/Short Ratio: To detect clustered flips indicating liquidation cascades.
2. Bollinger Bands: Specifically, Bollinger Bandwidth to measure volatility extremes.
3. Anchored VWAP: To identify key support and resistance levels for exit points.

By combining these elements, the VolatilityCascade strategy aims to capture significant moves following periods of high volatility and market dislocations, providing a structured approach to trading in volatile conditions.
