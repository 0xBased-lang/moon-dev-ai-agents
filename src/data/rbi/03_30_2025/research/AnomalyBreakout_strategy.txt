STRATEGY_NAME: AnomalyBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines mean-reversion signals from funding rates with trend-following technical triggers, creating a unique approach to capturing short-term bearish momentum during unfavorable funding conditions.

Key Components:
1. 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) - Primary trend filter
2. Funding Rate Analysis - Extreme negative values indicate potential mean-reversion opportunities
3. Average True Range (ATR) - Dynamic risk management tool

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for price to break BELOW the 50-period SMA (confirming bearish momentum)
2. Confirm funding rates are in extreme negative territory (suggesting overcrowded short positions)
3. Enter short position on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When funding rates normalize (return to neutral/positive territory)
2. Protective Exit: 2x ATR trailing stop (places stop at 2x current ATR below entry price, trails upward)
3. Optional Time Exit: Consider closing after 24-48 hours if neither trigger hits

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Maximum stop distance of 3x ATR if market extremely volatile
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may distort funding rates
4. Daily volume filter (only trade above average volume days)

Required Indicators:
1. 50-period SMA (simple moving average)
2. Funding Rate data (exchange-specific)
3. 14-period ATR (average true range)
4. Volume indicator (optional but recommended)

Special Considerations:
- Works best in trending markets with occasional funding anomalies
- Most effective on 1h-4h timeframes
- Requires monitoring of multiple exchanges' funding rates
- Performs poorly during prolonged bear markets with sustained negative funding

Optimization Tips:
1. Test different SMA periods (40-60 range)
2. Experiment with ATR multipliers (1.5x-3x)
3. Add volume confirmation filter
4. Consider combining with RSI for overbought confirmation

This "AnomalyBreakout" strategy uniquely combines fundamental funding data with technical breakouts, creating a high-probability shorting opportunity when the crowd is overly bearish but price action confirms downside momentum.
