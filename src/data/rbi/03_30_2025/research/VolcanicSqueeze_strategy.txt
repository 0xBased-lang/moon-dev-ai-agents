STRATEGY_NAME: VolcanicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- Combines Bollinger Bands (BB) and Keltner Channels (KC) to identify high-probability breakout opportunities
- Uses volume surge (3x average) as confirmation filter
- Relies on ADX for trend strength assessment to manage exits
- Specifically designed to capitalize on volatility contractions followed by explosive moves

2. Entry Rules:
- Wait for Bollinger Band squeeze condition (BB width at lowest 20% of 100-period range)
- Price must break outside Keltner Channel (upper for long, lower for short)
- Volume must surge to at least 3x 20-period average volume
- All three conditions must occur simultaneously for valid entry

3. Exit Rules:
- Primary exit: ADX(14) drops below 25 indicating weakening trend
- Secondary exit: Price closes back inside Keltner Channel
- Tertiary exit: Trailing stop at opposite Keltner Channel band

4. Risk Management:
- Initial stop placed at middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA)
- Position size calculated to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum of 3 concurrent positions to avoid overexposure
- Avoid trading during major economic news events due to volume distortions

5. Required Indicators:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Keltner Channels (20,2)
- Volume (20-period average)
- ADX (14-period)

6. Additional Notes:
- Best suited for 1H-4H timeframes on liquid instruments
- Performs exceptionally well during transitional market phases
- Requires patience as squeeze conditions may take time to develop
- Volume confirmation dramatically reduces false breakouts
- ADX filter prevents exiting during strong trending conditions

This strategy combines volatility contraction, channel breakout, volume confirmation, and trend strength assessment into a robust trading approach that filters out low-probability setups while capturing high-momentum moves.
