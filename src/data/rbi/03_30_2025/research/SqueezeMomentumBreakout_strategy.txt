STRATEGY_NAME: SqueezeMomentumBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band squeeze detection with momentum confirmation and force-based exits for high-probability breakout trading.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze Detection
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) for confirmation
3. Elder Force Index for exit signals
4. Volatility-adjusted thresholds

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band squeeze condition (bands within 1.5% of each other)
2. CMO (14-period) must cross above zero line from below
3. Price must break above upper Bollinger Band
4. All conditions must occur within 3 bars of each other

Exit Rules:
1. Primary Exit: When Elder Force Index (13-period) reverses direction and crosses below its 5-period SMA
2. Secondary Exit: If price closes below the middle Bollinger Band
3. Emergency Exit: 2% stop-loss from entry price

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 2% of capital per trade
2. Maximum 5 open positions at any time
3. Daily loss limit of 5% across all positions
4. Trade only during high-volume hours (first 2 hours of session)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Chande Momentum Oscillator (14)
3. Elder Force Index (13)
4. 5-period SMA of Force Index

Optimization Notes:
1. Adjust squeeze threshold based on asset volatility
2. Test different CMO periods (10-20) for different timeframes
3. Consider adding volume filter for breakout confirmation
4. Backtest force index threshold for optimal exits

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the squeeze to identify potential breakouts and momentum/force indicators to confirm entries and exits with reduced whipsaw risk.
