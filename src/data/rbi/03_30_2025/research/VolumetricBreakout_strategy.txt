STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
This strategy combines trend strength analysis (ADX) with volume divergence (OBV) to identify false breakouts, then uses Bollinger Bands for exit signals.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **ADX (Average Directional Index)** - Measures trend strength (threshold: >25 for valid trend)  
2. **OBV (On-Balance Volume)** - Detects volume divergence vs. price movement  
3. **Bollinger Bands** - Identifies volatility contraction for exits  

**Entry Rules (Long Example):**  
1. Price makes a new high (potential breakout)  
2. ADX > 25 (confirms strong trend)  
3. OBV fails to confirm (shows lower high while price makes higher high - bearish divergence)  
4. Enter short on next candle open  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. When Bollinger Band width contracts to X-period low (volatility collapse)  
2. Alternative exit: When ADX drops below 20 (trend weakening)  

**Risk Management:**  
1. Stop-loss placed at recent swing high/low beyond entry candle  
2. Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade  
3. Only trade during high-volume market hours  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. ADX (14-period standard)  
2. OBV  
3. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard settings)  

**Special Notes:**  
- Works best in ranging markets with fake breakouts  
- Requires confirmation from both volume AND trend strength  
- Avoid during strong trending periods without divergence
