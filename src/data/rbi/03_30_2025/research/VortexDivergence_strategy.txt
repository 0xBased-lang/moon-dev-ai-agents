STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Confirms trend direction (bullish when VI+ > VI-, bearish when VI- > VI+).  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** Identifies divergence (price makes higher highs while OBV makes lower highs = bearish signal; price makes lower lows while OBV makes higher lows = bullish signal).  
3. **Keltner Channel (KC):** Acts as a volatility-based exit trigger (middle line = EMA, outer bands = ATR-based).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  1. VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish trend confirmation).  
  2. OBV shows bullish divergence (price lower low, OBV higher low).  
  3. Enter at the next candle’s open.  
- **Short Entry:**  
  1. VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish trend confirmation).  
  2. OBV shows bearish divergence (price higher high, OBV lower high).  
  3. Enter at the next candle’s open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Close position when price closes below the Keltner Channel’s lower band.  
- **Short Exit:** Close position when price closes above the Keltner Channel’s upper band.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss at 1.5x the ATR (used in Keltner Channel) from entry price.  
- Position size capped at 2% of capital per trade.  
- Avoid trading during major economic news events to reduce false signals.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI) – Default period (14).  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV) – No settings, raw values.  
3. Keltner Channel – EMA (20), ATR multiplier (2.0), ATR period (10).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines trend confirmation (VI), volume-backed divergence (OBV), and volatility exits (KC) for high-probability mean-reversion or breakout trades.
