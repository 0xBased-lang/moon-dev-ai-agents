STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthSurge  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Width Contraction:** Identifies periods of low volatility when the Bollinger Band width reaches a 20-day low, signaling potential breakout conditions.  
2. **Klinger Volume Oscillator Divergence:** Confirms breakout strength by detecting a surge in volume divergence, indicating strong buying or selling pressure.  
3. **Parabolic SAR Reversals:** Used for exit signals when the price reverses direction, confirmed by two consecutive SAR dots switching sides.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a **long** trade when:  
  - Bollinger Band width contracts to a 20-day low (indicating compression).  
  - Klinger Volume Oscillator shows bullish divergence (rising while price is flat or declining).  
  - Price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band.  
- Enter a **short** trade when:  
  - Bollinger Band width contracts to a 20-day low.  
  - Klinger Volume Oscillator shows bearish divergence (falling while price is flat or rising).  
  - Price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the trade when:  
  - Two consecutive Parabolic SAR dots appear on the opposite side of the price (e.g., two dots above price for a long trade).  
  - Alternatively, use a trailing stop or fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1) if SAR signals are delayed.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Set stop-loss just outside the opposite Bollinger Band (for long trades, below the lower band; for short trades, above the upper band).  
- Position sizing should align with volatility (e.g., ATR-based stops to adjust for market conditions).  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 standard deviations) – To measure volatility contraction.  
2. **Klinger Volume Oscillator** – To confirm volume divergence.  
3. **Parabolic SAR** (default settings) – For exit signals.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Best suited for **15-minute to 4-hour timeframes** in trending markets.  
- Works well in **forex, commodities, and indices** with sufficient liquidity.  
- Avoid ranging markets where false breakouts are frequent.  

This strategy combines volatility compression, volume confirmation, and a mechanical exit system for disciplined trading.
