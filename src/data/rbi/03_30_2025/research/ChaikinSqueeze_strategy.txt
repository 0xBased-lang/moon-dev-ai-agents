STRATEGY_NAME: ChaikinSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) Momentum:** Uses the 3-day rate of change (ROC) of CMF to gauge short-term money flow strength.  
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Identifies low volatility periods (squeeze) as potential breakout setups.  
3. **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Divergence:** Confirms entries when price diverges from the 20-day VWAP with supporting volume.  
4. **Volume Confirmation:** Ensures trades are taken only when volume validates the momentum signal.  

**Entry Rules:**  
1. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Condition:** Wait for Bollinger Bands to contract (bandwidth narrows significantly, indicating low volatility).  
2. **CMF Momentum Signal:** The 3-day ROC of CMF must be positive (rising money flow) and above a predefined threshold (e.g., >0.05).  
3. **VWAP Divergence:** Price must break away from the 20-day VWAP (either above or below, depending on direction).  
4. **Volume Confirmation:** Volume on the breakout candle should be higher than the 10-day average volume.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Profit Target:** Use a trailing stop or fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2:1). Alternatively, exit when CMF ROC turns negative.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Place below the recent swing low (for long) or above the swing high (for short). Alternatively, use Bollinger Band width expansion as an exit signal.  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Tight stop to avoid volatility traps—adjust based on Bollinger Band width.  
3. **Avoid Overlapping Signals:** Only trade when all conditions align (squeeze + CMF ROC + VWAP divergence + volume).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)** – 20-period default.  
2. **Bollinger Bands** – 20-period, 2 standard deviations.  
3. **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)** – 20-day period.  
4. **Volume** – 10-day average for confirmation.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines money flow momentum (CMF) with volatility contraction (Bollinger Squeeze).  
- Uses VWAP divergence as a trend-confirmation filter.  
- Volume acts as a final gatekeeper to avoid false breakouts.  

This strategy is best suited for swing trading in trending markets with periodic low-volatility phases.
