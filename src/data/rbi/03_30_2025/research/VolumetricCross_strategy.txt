STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricCross  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Trend Confirmation:** Uses the 50-period EMA crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) to identify bullish trends.  
2. **Volume Filter:** Requires a high-volume spike (2x the average volume) to confirm strong participation in the trend.  
3. **Momentum Exit:** Relies on the RSI crossing below 70 to exit trades, avoiding overbought conditions.  
4. **Risk-Reward Management:** Targets a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio for disciplined profit-taking.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Enter a long position when:  
  1. The 50-period EMA crosses above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross).  
  2. Volume is at least 2x the average volume (e.g., 20-period average volume).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Exit the long position when:  
  1. RSI (14-period) crosses below 70 (signaling potential overbought reversal).  
  2. Stop-loss is placed below the recent swing low or using a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%).  
  3. Take-profit is set at 2x the stop-loss distance (e.g., if stop-loss is 1%, take-profit is 2%).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should align with risk tolerance (e.g., risking 1-2% of capital per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low liquidity or major news events to prevent false volume spikes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14-period).  
4. Volume indicator (e.g., 20-period average volume for comparison).  

**Notes:**  
- Works best in trending markets; may underperform in choppy or sideways conditions.  
- Volume spike validation reduces false signals from EMA crosses alone.  
- Adjust RSI threshold (e.g., 60-80) based on asset volatility.  

This strategy combines trend-following, volume confirmation, and momentum-based exits for a balanced approach.
