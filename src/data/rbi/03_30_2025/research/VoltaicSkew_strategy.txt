STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSkew  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Regime Focus**: Targets shifts from low to high volatility environments.  
2. **IV Percentile Threshold**: Uses the 10-day implied volatility (IV) percentile crossing above 80 as a primary filter.  
3. **Delta Skew Divergence**: Requires simultaneous *negative* delta skew divergence (skew trending downward while IV rises).  
4. **Exit Mechanic**: Relies on mean-reversion of the IV/spot correlation (e.g., when IV stabilizes or reverts relative to spot price movement).  

**Entry Rules:**  
- Trigger: 10-day IV percentile > 80 (indicating elevated volatility).  
- Confirmation: Negative delta skew divergence (skew declining as IV rises, signaling bearish sentiment mismatch).  
- Entry Type: Likely short volatility (e.g., selling options or spreads) given the skew divergence context.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- Primary: IV/spot correlation mean-reversion (e.g., IV decelerates while spot stabilizes or reverses).  
- Secondary: Fixed profit target (e.g., 1.5x risk) or trailing stop based on IV percentile dropping below 60.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position Sizing: Allocate 1–3% of capital per trade due to volatility sensitivity.  
- Stop-Loss: Exit if IV percentile surges further (e.g., > 90) *without* skew divergence confirmation.  
- Hedging: Consider long-delta hedges (e.g., long underlying) if skew divergence weakens abruptly.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **10-Day IV Percentile** (historical implied volatility range).  
2. **Delta Skew** (measure of put/call demand imbalance).  
3. **IV/Spot Correlation** (rolling correlation between IV and price moves).  

**Unique Edge:** Combines *regime shift timing* (IV percentile) with *sentiment confirmation* (skew divergence), avoiding false breakouts in volatile markets. The name "VoltaicSkew" reflects the strategy’s focus on abrupt volatility shifts ("Voltaic") and skew-based filtering ("Skew").
