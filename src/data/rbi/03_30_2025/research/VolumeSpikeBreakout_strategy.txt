STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeSpikeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume-weighted moving averages, money flow confirmation, and Renko-based stop management for high-probability breakout trading.

Key Components:
1. Volume-Weighted Trend Filter: Uses 50-period and 200-period volume-weighted MAs (VWMA) to identify the underlying trend
2. Money Flow Confirmation: Requires Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) > 0.25 to confirm buying pressure
3. Renko Brick Stop Management: Uses Renko brick reversals for dynamic stop placement

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50-period VWMA crosses above 200-period VWMA (bullish crossover)
2. Confirmation: CMF must spike above 0.25 on the same candle as the crossover or immediately after
3. Execution: Enter long on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: 
   - Primary: Trail stop using Renko brick reversals
   - Alternative: Take partial profits at 2:1 risk-reward ratio
2. Stop Loss: 
   - Initial stop placed at most recent Renko brick reversal level
   - Stop moves to breakeven when price reaches 1.5x initial risk

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Placement: Always use Renko brick reversal levels for dynamic stops
3. Filter: Avoid trading during low volume periods (volume < 20-period average)

Required Indicators:
1. Volume-Weighted Moving Averages (50 & 200 periods)
2. Chaikin Money Flow (20-period standard settings)
3. Renko Charts (brick size should be approximately 1-2x the average true range)

Additional Notes:
- Works best on 1H or 4H timeframes for swing trading
- Most effective in trending markets - avoid ranging conditions
- Combine with price action confirmation for higher accuracy
- Backtest optimal Renko brick size for your instrument
