STRATEGY_NAME: VortexConfirmation  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI):** Tracks directional movement (positive VI+ and negative VI- lines) to identify trend reversals.  
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** Confirms trend strength and direction by analyzing volume flow.  
3. **Keltner Channels:** Volatility-based bands used to identify overextended price movements and potential exit points.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** VI+ crosses above VI- **AND** OBV is in an uptrend (higher highs/lows).  
- **Short Entry:** VI- crosses above VI+ **AND** OBV is in a downtrend (lower highs/lows).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** Price closes below the lower Keltner Channel band **AND** Average True Range (ATR) is below a defined low-volatility threshold.  
- **Short Exit:** Price closes above the upper Keltner Channel band **AND** ATR is below the low-volatility threshold.  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place stops at the recent swing high/low (for short/long) or use a fixed percentage (e.g., 1-2%).  
- **Position Sizing:** Adjust based on volatility (e.g., larger positions during high OBV momentum, smaller in low ATR conditions).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+, VI-)  
2. On-Balance Volume (OBV)  
3. Keltner Channels (20-period EMA, 2x ATR width)  
4. Average True Range (ATR) for volatility filtering  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (VI + OBV) with volatility-based exits (Keltner + ATR).  
- Avoids false signals by requiring both momentum (VI) and volume (OBV) alignment.  
- Exits are optimized for low-volatility mean reversion scenarios.  

**Note:** Backtest to fine-tune ATR thresholds and OBV trend confirmation rules for specific assets.
