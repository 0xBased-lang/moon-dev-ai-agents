1. Key Strategy Components:
- Dual volatility signal confirmation (VIX term structure inversion + VVIX spike)
- Bollinger Band squeeze condition on the underlying index (SPX/SPY)
- Momentum-based exit using band width expansion

2. Entry Rules:
LONG ENTRY:
- VIX term structure inverts (front month > second month)
- VVIX shows >15% spike from previous close
- Underlying index shows Bollinger Band squeeze (band width < 50% of 20-day average)
- Price closes above middle Bollinger Band

SHORT ENTRY:
- VIX term structure inverts (front month > second month) 
- VVIX shows >15% spike from previous close
- Underlying index shows Bollinger Band squeeze (band width < 50% of 20-day average)
- Price closes below middle Bollinger Band

3. Exit Rules:
- Take profit when Bollinger Band width expands to 2x the squeeze threshold
- Stop loss at opposite band (upper band for shorts, lower band for longs)
- Time-based exit after 5 trading days if no target hit

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1% risk per trade
- Maximum portfolio allocation of 5% to this strategy
- No overlapping positions in same direction
- Daily volatility check (abandon trade if VIX drops >10% from entry)

5. Required Indicators:
- VIX futures term structure (front two months)
- VVIX index with 15% spike filter
- Bollinger Bands (20,2) with width measurement
- Historical band width average (20-day)

6. Special Considerations:
- Works best during market regime transitions
- Requires monitoring of both volatility indices
- Most effective on SPX/SPY but can adapt to NDX/QQQ
- Avoid trading during Fed announcement days

The "Volterra Divergence" name reflects:
1. "Volterra" - Combines volatility and terrain (representing the complex volatility landscape)
2. "Divergence" - The core signal of VIX/VVIX divergence with price action
This captures the strategy's unique approach of combining multiple volatility dimensions with technical patterns.
