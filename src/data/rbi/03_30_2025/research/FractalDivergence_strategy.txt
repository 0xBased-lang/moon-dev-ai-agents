STRATEGY_NAME: FractalDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend reversal signals from Heikin-Ashi candles with money flow divergence and fractal-based risk management, creating a multi-timeframe approach to counter-trend trading.

Key Components:
1. Heikin-Ashi Trend Analysis (4H): Identifies prevailing trend direction
2. Chaikin Money Flow Divergence (1H): Confirms weakening momentum
3. Fractal Swing Points: Provides precise stop-loss levels
4. Renko Brick Reversals: Determines profit targets

Entry Rules:
LONG:
- 4H Heikin-Ashi candle closes bullish (green) after bearish trend
- 1H Chaikin Money Flow shows bullish divergence (higher lows while price makes lower lows)
- Entry at open of next candle after confirmation

SHORT:
- 4H Heikin-Ashi candle closes bearish (red) after bullish trend
- 1H Chaikin Money Flow shows bearish divergence (lower highs while price makes higher highs)
- Entry at open of next candle after confirmation

Exit Rules:
- Stop-loss: Placed at most recent fractal swing low (long) or high (short)
- Profit Target: Exit when Renko bricks reverse direction (2-3 brick reversal recommended)
- Optional: Trail stop to new fractal points as trade progresses

Risk Management:
- Position sizing based on 1-2% risk per trade
- Minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio required
- Avoid trading during major news events
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions

Required Indicators:
1. Heikin-Ashi candles (4H timeframe)
2. Chaikin Money Flow (1H timeframe)
3. Fractal indicator (all timeframes)
4. Renko charts (for target confirmation)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid forex pairs and indices
- Requires confirmation across all components
- Works best in ranging or slowing trend markets
- May produce false signals in strong trending markets
- Recommended to combine with volume analysis for confirmation

This strategy excels at catching early trend reversals while maintaining tight risk control through fractal-based stops and objective profit targets via Renko bricks.
