STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidityBreakout  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Level Clusters:** The strategy identifies price zones where clustered liquidation levels (stop-loss concentrations) are likely to trigger significant market moves.  
2. **ADX Confirmation:** Uses the Average Directional Index (ADX) above 30 to confirm strong trending conditions before entering trades.  
3. **Order Book Imbalance:** Monitors order book liquidity voids (areas with thin liquidity) to project breakout targets.  
4. **Breakout Execution:** Enters trades when price breaches key liquidation zones with momentum, aiming for continuation into liquidity voids.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Signal Trigger:** Price approaches a dense liquidation level cluster (identified via historical stop-loss analysis or order book heatmaps).  
- **ADX Filter:** ADX must be > 30 to ensure the breakout has high-probability momentum.  
- **Breakout Confirmation:** Enter long/short on a close above/below the liquidation zone with elevated volume or order book imbalance.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Exit at the next liquidity void (e.g., where opposing stop orders cluster or order book depth thins significantly).  
- **Stop-Loss:** Place stops beyond the opposite side of the liquidation zone or a recent swing low/high.  
- **Trailing Stop:** Use a dynamic trailing stop (e.g., ATR-based) if the trend extends beyond initial targets.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size limited to 1-2% of capital per trade.  
- Stop-loss must be placed before entry, respecting the volatility of the liquidation zone (e.g., 1.5x the average candle range).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods (e.g., weekends or off-market hours).  

**Required Indicators/Tools:**  
1. **ADX (14-period)** – To gauge trend strength.  
2. **Order Book Depth/Heatmap** – To identify liquidation clusters and liquidity voids.  
3. **Volume Profile** – To confirm high-volume breakouts.  
4. **ATR (14-period)** – For dynamic stop placement.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines liquidation-driven price action with quantifiable order book imbalances, targeting high-probability breakouts in trending markets. Avoids false breakouts via ADX filtering and real-time liquidity analysis.
