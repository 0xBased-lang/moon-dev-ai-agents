STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicFisher  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
The VoltaicFisher strategy combines momentum and volatility expansion signals with trend confirmation from the Fisher Transform for high-probability entries, using Parabolic SAR for disciplined exits.  

**Key Components:**  
1. **Fisher Transform (14-period):** Normalizes price to identify extreme moves and potential reversals. Bullish when Fisher crosses above signal line, bearish when below.  
2. **Volatility Bands (20-period ATR, 2x multiplier):** Dynamic bands that expand during volatile conditions. Upper band = SMA + (ATR×2), lower band = SMA - (ATR×2).  
3. **Parabolic SAR (0.02 step, 0.2 max):** Trailing stop for exit signals.  

**Entry Rules (Long):**  
- Price closes **above upper volatility band** AND  
- Fisher Transform crosses **above its signal line** (confirming bullish momentum).  
- Enter on next candle’s open.  

**Entry Rules (Short):**  
- Price closes **below lower volatility band** AND  
- Fisher Transform crosses **below its signal line** (confirming bearish momentum).  
- Enter on next candle’s open.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Parabolic SAR flips** to opposite side of position (e.g., SAR dots appear above price for long exit).  
- Optional: Secondary exit if Fisher reverses direction (e.g., crosses signal line opposite to trade direction).  

**Risk Management:**  
- **Stop-loss:** Place at recent swing low (long) or swing high (short) outside volatility bands.  
- **Position sizing:** Risk ≤1-2% per trade based on stop distance.  
- **Filter:** Avoid trades during low ATR (volatility contraction).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Fisher Transform (14-period)  
2. ATR (20-period) for volatility bands  
3. SMA (20-period) as band baseline  
4. Parabolic SAR (0.02, 0.2)  

**Unique Edge:**  
- Volatility bands adapt to market conditions, while Fisher filters false breakouts.  
- SAR ensures profit retention during strong trends. Best suited for **15min-4H timeframes** in trending markets.  

**Backtest Note:** Optimize ATR multiplier (1.5-3x) and Fisher period (10-20) for asset-specific volatility.
