STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationFade

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on short-term price distortions caused by high-frequency liquidation events, fading the spike and profiting from the subsequent retracement to normalized levels.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation Cluster Detection: Identifies forced liquidations via order book imbalance metrics (bid/ask volume ratios)
2. Spike Quantification: Measures the magnitude of price movement from pre-event VWAP
3. Mean Reversion: Expects price to return to pre-spike equilibrium levels

Entry Rules:
1. Trigger: When price spikes >2% from VWAP within 5 minutes
2. Confirmation: Order book shows >70% imbalance in spike direction (indicating forced liquidations)
3. Entry: Short position at spike peak (for upward spikes) or long position at spike trough (for downward spikes)

Exit Rules:
1. Primary: When price retraces to pre-spike VWAP level
2. Secondary: If price continues beyond spike extreme by >1%, stop out
3. Time-based: Close position if not profitable within 30 minutes

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade
2. Stop loss: 1.5x spike magnitude beyond entry point
3. Maximum daily trades: 5 to avoid overexposure to volatile conditions

Required Indicators:
1. Real-time VWAP (15-minute lookback)
2. Order book imbalance indicator (bid/ask volume ratio)
3. Price change alert (>2% within 5 minutes)
4. Liquidation volume metrics (when available)

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in high-liquidity markets during periods of elevated leverage
- Most effective when overall market volatility is moderate (not trending strongly)
- Avoid news events/fundamental catalysts that may override technical retracement

Note: Requires fast execution capabilities to capitalize on short-lived opportunities. Works particularly well in crypto markets with high leverage ratios.
