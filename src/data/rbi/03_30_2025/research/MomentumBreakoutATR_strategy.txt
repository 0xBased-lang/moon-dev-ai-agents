STRATEGY_NAME: MomentumBreakoutATR

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend confirmation, momentum strength, and volatility-based exits for high-probability breakout trading. Here are the key components:

1. TREND CONFIRMATION:
- Uses the golden cross (50 EMA crossing above 200 EMA) as primary trend filter
- EMA crossover must be confirmed by price trading above both EMAs

2. MOMENTUM FILTER:
- ADX must be rising and above 25 threshold
- This confirms strong directional movement supporting the breakout

3. ENTRY RULES:
- Enter long when:
  a) 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA
  b) Price is trading above both EMAs
  c) ADX > 25 and rising
  d) Price breaks recent high (confirms breakout)

4. EXIT MECHANISM:
- Uses 2x ATR trailing stop
- Stop moves up with price but never down
- Calculated as: Highest High since entry - (2 x current ATR)

5. RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Initial stop placed at entry price - (2 x ATR)
- Position size calculated based on stop distance
- Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade

6. REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period EMA
- Average Directional Index (ADX) - 14 period recommended
- Average True Range (ATR) - 14 period recommended

7. OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Test different ADX thresholds (20-30)
- Experiment with ATR multiples (1.5-3x)
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

8. BEST MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best in trending markets
- Avoid ranging periods (when ADX < 20)
- Most effective on daily or 4H timeframes

This strategy combines the reliability of EMA crossovers with momentum confirmation and smart volatility-based exits, creating a robust trend-following system. The 2x ATR trailing stop helps capture extended moves while protecting profits.
