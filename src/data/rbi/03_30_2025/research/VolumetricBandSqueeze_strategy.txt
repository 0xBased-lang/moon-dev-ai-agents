STRATEGY_NAME: VolumetricBandSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volume confirmation with volatility contraction patterns for high-probability breakout trades. The core premise identifies low-volatility conditions through Bollinger Band width contraction while using On-Balance Volume (OBV) divergence to confirm the underlying strength of the impending breakout.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Width Contraction: Measures volatility compression preceding breakouts
2. OBV Divergence: Confirms accumulation/distribution before price movement
3. Band Breakout: Signals the actual trade entry point
4. Opposite Band Touch: Provides clear exit mechanism

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Bollinger Band width must be below its 20-period average (contraction)
2. Price must show higher lows while OBV shows higher highs (bullish divergence)
3. Price must close above upper Bollinger Band
4. OBV must be above its 21-period EMA (confirming uptrend)

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Bollinger Band width must be below its 20-period average (contraction)
2. Price must show lower highs while OBV shows lower lows (bearish divergence)
3. Price must close below lower Bollinger Band
4. OBV must be below its 21-period EMA (confirming downtrend)

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Exit when price touches the lower Bollinger Band
2. For short positions: Exit when price touches the upper Bollinger Band
3. Emergency exit if OBV crosses its 21-period EMA against position direction

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at opposite band (for longs: lower band, for shorts: upper band)
3. Trailing stop option: Move stop to breakeven when price reaches 1.5x initial risk
4. Maximum daily loss limit of 5% of capital

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
2. Bollinger Band Width indicator (20-period SMA of width)
3. On-Balance Volume (OBV)
4. 21-period EMA of OBV

Optimal Conditions:
- Works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends
- Most effective on 1-hour to daily timeframes
- Ideal for liquid assets with strong volume patterns
- Avoid during high-impact news events

Additional Filters:
- Volume should be above 20-period average on breakout
- For equities, confirm with sector/industry trend alignment
- For forex, confirm with correlated asset volume patterns

This strategy capitalizes on the explosive moves following volatility contractions while using volume analysis to filter false breakouts. The combination of technical patterns with volume confirmation creates a robust trading edge.
