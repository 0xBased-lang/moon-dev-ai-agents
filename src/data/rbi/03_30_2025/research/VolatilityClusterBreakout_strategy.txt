STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityClusterBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility compression, channel breakout, and volume-confirmed reversal signals for high-probability trades. The core approach identifies low-volatility conditions followed by explosive breakouts, with intelligent exit management.

Key Components:
1. Chaikin Volatility (10-day) - Measures market volatility
2. Keltner Channel - Identifies potential breakout levels
3. ATR (2x) - Sets dynamic exit thresholds
4. Volume-weighted price clusters - Confirms reversal signals

Entry Rules:
LONG:
1. 10-day Chaikin Volatility drops below 20th percentile (low volatility regime)
2. Price closes ABOVE upper Keltner Channel band
3. Enter at next open with stop below recent swing low

SHORT:
1. 10-day Chaikin Volatility drops below 20th percentile
2. Price closes BELOW lower Keltner Channel band
3. Enter at next open with stop above recent swing high

Exit Rules:
1. Initial exit when price reverses by 2x ATR from entry point
2. Confirmation requires closing price to form a new cluster (3+ closes) on volume > 20-day average
3. Trail stop to breakeven after 1x ATR move in favor
4. Close entire position when both conditions trigger

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1-2% risk per trade
2. Initial stop placed at 1.5x ATR from entry
3. Maximum portfolio exposure capped at 10%
4. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades

Required Indicators:
1. Chaikin Volatility (10-day period)
2. Keltner Channel (20-day EMA, 2x ATR width)
3. ATR (14-day period)
4. Volume 20-day moving average
5. Price clustering detection (3-period minimum)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different volatility percentile thresholds (15th-25th)
- Adjust Keltner Channel multiplier (1.5x-2.5x ATR)
- Experiment with cluster confirmation periods (2-4 closes)
- Consider adding RSI filter for overbought/oversold conditions

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using volatility contraction as an early warning signal and volume-confirmed clusters to avoid false breakouts. The dual exit mechanism protects profits while allowing runners to develop.
