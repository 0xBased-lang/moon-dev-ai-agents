STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by explosive price movements, combining Bollinger Band contraction with historical volatility thresholds and ATR-based exits.

Key Components:
1. Volatility Measurement:
   - 20-period Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations)
   - 20-period Historical Volatility (standard deviation of logarithmic returns)
   - Threshold set when Bollinger Band width < Historical Volatility

2. Breakout Trigger:
   - Long entry when price closes above upper Bollinger Band after squeeze condition
   - Short entry when price closes below lower Bollinger Band after squeeze condition

3. Exit Mechanism:
   - Trailing stop based on 1.5x the 14-period ATR
   - Alternative exit when opposite Bollinger Band is touched

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to contract below 20-period Historical Volatility
2. Enter long on first close above upper band after squeeze confirmation
3. Enter short on first close below lower band after squeeze confirmation

Exit Rules:
1. Initial stop placed at 1.5x ATR from entry price
2. Trail stop daily maintaining 1.5x ATR distance
3. Close position if price touches opposite Bollinger Band

Risk Management:
1. Position size calculated using 1% risk of capital
2. Maximum stop distance of 2x ATR for position sizing
3. No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 period, 2 std dev)
2. Historical Volatility (20 period)
3. Average True Range (14 period)

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust ATR multiplier (1.3-2.0) based on asset volatility
- Test different lookback periods (14-30) for volatility comparison
- Consider adding volume confirmation for breakout validity

This strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trends, avoiding false signals during prolonged low-volatility periods. The VoltaicSqueeze name reflects the electrical charge-like potential energy release when volatility expands after compression.
