STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationReversal  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Liquidation Clusters Identification:** Uses futures market heatmap data to pinpoint areas where high liquidation activity is clustered, indicating potential reversal zones.  
2. **Order Book Depth Imbalance Confirmation:** Requires a sudden spike in order book depth imbalance (e.g., bid/ask ratio extremes) to validate the reversal signal.  
3. **Volatility Bands for Exits:** Utilizes historical volatility bands (e.g., Bollinger Bands or ATR-based bands) to define exit points when price retraces beyond these levels.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Signal Trigger:** A clustered liquidation level is identified on the heatmap, suggesting a potential exhaustion point.  
- **Confirmation:** A sharp order book depth imbalance (e.g., >70% bids or asks) must occur near the liquidation zone.  
- **Entry Execution:** Enter a reversal trade (long or short) once both conditions align, preferably on a candlestick close confirming the reversal (e.g., pin bar, engulfing pattern).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Profit Target:** Partial exits at predefined risk-reward ratios (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) based on the distance to the nearest liquidity pool or support/resistance level.  
- **Stop Loss:** Placed beyond the volatility band (e.g., 2x ATR or outside Bollinger Band) or the recent swing high/low.  
- **Trailing Stop:** Adjust stop to breakeven or tighten it using the volatility bands as price moves favorably.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing based on a fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 1-2% per trade).  
- Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods or major news events to prevent false signals.  
- Maximum daily loss limit (e.g., 5% of account) to prevent overexposure.  

**Required Indicators/Tools:**  
1. Futures liquidation heatmap (e.g., from Coinalyze, Bybit, or TradingView custom scripts).  
2. Order book depth and imbalance tracker (e.g., DOM or L2 data tools).  
3. Historical volatility bands (Bollinger Bands or ATR-based bands).  
4. Candlestick patterns for additional confirmation.  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines liquidation-driven sentiment analysis with real-time order flow dynamics.  
- Exits are volatility-adaptive, reducing whipsaw losses.  
- Avoids traditional indicators like RSI/MACD, focusing purely on market microstructure.  

**Note:** Backtest heatmap reliability and order book responsiveness for the specific asset, as crypto and forex may behave differently.
