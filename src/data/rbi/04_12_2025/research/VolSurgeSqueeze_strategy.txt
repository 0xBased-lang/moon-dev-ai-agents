STRATEGY_NAME: VolSurgeSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volume Surge Filter**: Identifies high-interest stocks with a 3-day volume exceeding 150% of the 20-day average, signaling potential accumulation/distribution.  
2. **Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction**: Detects low volatility periods (Bandwidth < 10%) preceding potential breakouts.  
3. **MACD Crossover Confirmation**: Validates breakout direction (bullish/bearish) using MACD line crossing signal line.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry**:  
  - 3-day volume > 1.5x 20-day average volume  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth < 10%  
  - Price breaks **above** upper Bollinger Band  
  - MACD line crosses **above** signal line (bullish confirmation)  

- **Short Entry**:  
  - 3-day volume > 1.5x 20-day average volume  
  - Bollinger Bandwidth < 10%  
  - Price breaks **below** lower Bollinger Band  
  - MACD line crosses **below** signal line (bearish confirmation)  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit**:  
  - 2x ATR (14-period) from entry price  
  - OR Bollinger Bandwidth expands to > 20% (volatility spike)  
- **Stop Loss**:  
  - 1x ATR (14-period) from entry price  
  - OR opposite Bollinger Band break (invalidates thesis)  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size capped at 2% of capital per trade.  
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (cool-off period).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Volume (20-day average + 3-day surge filter)  
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) + Bandwidth calculation:  
   - `(Upper Band - Lower Band) / Middle Band * 100`  
3. MACD (12,26,9)  
4. ATR (14) for stop/target sizing  

**Unique Edge:** Combines **unusual volume activity** (institutional interest) with **volatility squeeze** (compressed energy) and **momentum confirmation** (MACD), reducing false breakouts.
