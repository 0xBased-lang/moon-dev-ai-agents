STRATEGY_NAME: DeltaBand Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction patterns with negative delta volume divergence to identify high-probability breakout opportunities. The unique aspect lies in requiring both technical contraction and volume-based confirmation before entering trades.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Band Contraction: Measures periods of low volatility where bands tighten significantly
2. Negative Delta Volume Divergence: Identifies when price moves opposite to volume flow
3. Volatility Threshold: Defines exit conditions based on reduced momentum

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band contraction (bands within X% of each other for Y periods)
2. Confirm negative delta volume divergence (price rising while delta volume decreases)
3. Enter long on breakout above upper band OR short below lower band
4. Require minimum volume surge of Z% above average

Exit Rules:
1. Close position when volatility contracts below threshold (bands narrow to W% of breakout width)
2. Secondary exit if price returns inside bands for N consecutive periods
3. Emergency stop at X% below entry for longs or above entry for shorts

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on band width at entry (wider bands = smaller position)
2. Maximum risk per trade limited to Y% of capital
3. No new entries if last 3 trades were losers

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 period, 2 std dev recommended)
2. Delta Volume indicator (showing cumulative buying/selling pressure)
3. Volatility contraction measurement tool
4. Volume moving average (for surge detection)

Optimization Notes:
- Test different contraction thresholds (X%) for various instruments
- Adjust volume surge requirements (Z%) based on market liquidity
- Fine-tune volatility exit thresholds (W%) to balance profit capture vs premature exits

This strategy excels in ranging markets transitioning to trends, using the unique combination of volume divergence and volatility patterns to filter false breakouts. The delta volume component adds a layer of confirmation missing from standard Bollinger Band strategies.
