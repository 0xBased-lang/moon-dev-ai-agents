STRATEGY_NAME: VolCompressSurge

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Key Components:
1. Volatility Compression: Uses Bollinger Band width percentile (<5%) to identify extreme compression periods
2. Volume Surge: Requires simultaneous 90th percentile volume spike for confirmation
3. Breakout Execution: Enters on breakout from compression pattern
4. Keltner Channel Exit: Uses opposing Keltner Channel levels for profit-taking

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for Bollinger Band width to reach <5% percentile (extreme compression)
2. Confirm with volume spike in 90th percentile of recent volume history
3. Enter long on breakout above upper Bollinger Band or short below lower Bollinger Band
4. Entry only valid if both conditions occur within same 2-hour candle

Exit Rules:
1. For long positions: Exit at upper Keltner Channel level
2. For short positions: Exit at lower Keltner Channel level
3. Optional: Partial profit-taking at mid-Keltner Channel level

Risk Management:
1. Set stop-loss at opposite Bollinger Band level from entry
2. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
3. Avoid trading during major news events that may cause false breakouts
4. Maximum 5% portfolio risk across all positions

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
2. Bollinger Band Width (percentile calculation)
3. Volume indicator with percentile analysis
4. Keltner Channels (20-period, 1.5 ATR)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets with consistent volatility patterns
- Requires historical data for accurate percentile calculations
- Works best on 2-hour timeframe but can be adapted to 4-hour with adjustments
- Volume surge must be significant relative to recent volume history (not absolute values)
