STRATEGY_NAME: ZephyrMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This intraday momentum strategy combines statistical price deviation with trend confirmation filters for high-probability trades. The core approach uses a rolling Z-score of price deviation from VWAP as the primary momentum signal, enhanced by directional confirmation from both MACD and TEMA indicators.

Key Components:
1. VWAP Z-Score: Calculates how many standard deviations the current price is from VWAP (typically 20-period lookback)
2. MACD Filter: Uses standard MACD (12,26,9) for trend direction confirmation
3. TEMA Filter: Triple Exponential Moving Average (typically 8-period) for additional trend confirmation

Entry Rules (Long):
1. Price crosses above VWAP with Z-score > 1 (showing momentum)
2. MACD histogram is positive and above signal line
3. Price crosses above TEMA
4. All conditions must align within same candle

Entry Rules (Short):
1. Price crosses below VWAP with Z-score < -1
2. MACD histogram is negative and below signal line
3. Price crosses below TEMA
4. All conditions must align within same candle

Exit Rules:
1. Take Profit: When Z-score returns to mean (crosses 0) or reaches +2/-2 extremes
2. Stop Loss: Fixed percentage (e.g., 0.5-1%) or when VWAP Z-score reverses direction
3. Time Exit: Close all positions before market close

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on account risk (typically 1-2% per trade)
2. Maximum 3-5 concurrent positions
3. Avoid trading first/last 30 minutes of session
4. Pause trading during major news events

Required Indicators:
1. VWAP with 20-period standard deviation channel
2. MACD (12,26,9)
3. TEMA (8-period recommended)
4. Real-time Z-score calculation

Optimization Notes:
- Adjust Z-score thresholds based on volatility (higher for more volatile instruments)
- TEMA period can be optimized between 5-10 periods
- VWAP lookback period can be tested between 15-30 periods

This strategy excels in trending markets but may produce false signals during choppy conditions. The triple confirmation (Z-score, MACD, TEMA) helps filter out low-quality setups while capturing strong intraday momentum moves.
