STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityCompression

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
1. Key Strategy Components:
- This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility (compression) that often precede significant price movements
- Combines ATR-based volatility measurement with trend confirmation using the 200-day SMA
- Uses a dual exit system with both fixed and dynamic stop mechanisms

2. Entry Rules:
- Primary Condition: 10-day ATR must be below its 20-day moving average (volatility compression signal)
- Trend Filter: Price must be above the 200-day SMA (bullish trend confirmation)
- Entry Trigger: When both conditions are met simultaneously, enter long position on next candle open

3. Exit Rules:
- Hard Stop: 2x current ATR value from entry price (volatility-based risk control)
- Trailing Stop: 5% below the highest price reached since entry (profit protection)
- Exit when either stop condition is triggered (whichever comes first)

4. Risk Management:
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop distance
- Typical risk per trade should be 1-2% of capital
- No trades when price is below 200-day SMA (avoids counter-trend positions)

5. Required Indicators:
- 10-day ATR (Average True Range)
- 20-day SMA of ATR (smoothed volatility baseline)
- 200-day SMA (long-term trend filter)
- Current price relative to these indicators

6. Additional Notes:
- Works best in trending markets with periodic volatility contractions
- May generate fewer signals in highly volatile or range-bound markets
- Requires daily timeframe or higher for reliable signals
- Backtesting recommended across different market conditions

This "VolatilityCompression" strategy systematically identifies low-volatility setups within established uptrends, using measured exits to capture potential breakouts while strictly controlling risk. The combination of volatility measurement and trend filtering creates a disciplined approach to capturing momentum shifts.
