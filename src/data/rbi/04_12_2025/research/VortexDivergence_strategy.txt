STRATEGY_NAME: VortexDivergence  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  

**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-):** Used to confirm trend direction.  
   - VI+ > VI- suggests bullish momentum.  
   - VI- > VI+ suggests bearish momentum.  
2. **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** Measures money flow volume to detect divergence.  
   - Bullish divergence: Price makes lower lows while CMF makes higher lows.  
   - Bearish divergence: Price makes higher highs while CMF makes lower highs.  
3. **ADX (Average Directional Index):** Filters trades based on trend strength (ADX > 25 indicates a strong trend).  
4. **CMF Moving Average (e.g., 20-period SMA):** Used for exit signals.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:**  
  - VI+ crosses above VI- (bullish Vortex signal).  
  - CMF shows bullish divergence (price lower low, CMF higher low).  
  - ADX > 25 (confirms strong trend).  
- **Short Entry:**  
  - VI- crosses above VI+ (bearish Vortex signal).  
  - CMF shows bearish divergence (price higher high, CMF lower high).  
  - ADX > 25 (confirms strong trend).  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Long Exit:** CMF crosses below its moving average (e.g., 20-period SMA).  
- **Short Exit:** CMF crosses above its moving average (e.g., 20-period SMA).  

**Risk Management:**  
- Stop-loss placed below recent swing low (long) or above recent swing high (short).  
- Position sizing based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based stops).  
- Avoid trading if ADX < 25 (weak/no trend).  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Vortex Indicator (VI+ and VI-).  
2. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) + its moving average (e.g., 20-period SMA).  
3. ADX (14-period default).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines trend confirmation (Vortex) with volume-based divergence (CMF).  
- ADX ensures trades align with strong trends, reducing false signals.  
- Exits based on CMF momentum shift rather than static profit targets.  

This strategy is ideal for trending markets and avoids choppy conditions via ADX filtering.
