STRATEGY_NAME: VoltaicSqueeze  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Squeeze Identification:** Uses Bollinger Bandwidth (20,2) to detect periods of low volatility (10-day minimum bandwidth).  
2. **Breakout Confirmation:** Requires price to close outside the Keltner Channel (20,1.5) in the same direction as the squeeze resolution.  
3. **Exit Mechanism:** Implements a trailing stop set at 2x the 14-day ATR to lock in profits and limit losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Long Entry:** Triggered when:  
  1. Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 10-day low (squeeze condition).  
  2. Price closes ABOVE the upper Keltner Channel.  
- **Short Entry:** Triggered when:  
  1. Bollinger Bandwidth reaches a 10-day low (squeeze condition).  
  2. Price closes BELOW the lower Keltner Channel.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Trailing Stop:** Exit position when price reverses by 2x the 14-day ATR from the highest high (long) or lowest low (short) since entry.  
- **Optional Time Exit:** Close trade after 5 bars if no trailing stop is hit (prevoves stagnation).  

**Risk Management:**  
1. **Position Sizing:** Allocate ≤2% of capital per trade.  
2. **Stop Loss:** Initial stop set at 1x ATR from entry (optional for aggressive traders).  
3. **Filter:** Avoid trading during major economic news events to reduce false breakouts.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** – To calculate bandwidth squeeze.  
2. **Keltner Channel (20,1.5)** – For breakout confirmation.  
3. **ATR (14)** – For trailing stop and risk sizing.  

**Unique Edge:** Combines volatility contraction (Bollinger) with expansion signals (Keltner) while using adaptive exits (ATR) for dynamic risk/reward. Works best on 1H/4H timeframes in trending markets.
