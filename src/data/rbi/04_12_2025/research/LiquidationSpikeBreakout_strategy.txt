STRATEGY_NAME: LiquidationSpikeBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on breakout opportunities following liquidation-induced price spikes, confirmed by specific volume and volatility conditions. The approach combines order flow analysis with technical indicators for high-probability entries and disciplined exits.

Key Components:
1. Liquidation-triggered price spikes (market structure breaks)
2. Negative delta volume surge (3x normal levels)
3. Bollinger Bandwidth contraction (below 10-day average)
4. Volatility-based exits (20-day ATR threshold)

Entry Rules:
1. Wait for a significant price spike (minimum 2% move) indicating potential liquidations
2. Confirm with negative delta volume at least 3x the 20-period average
3. Verify Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) is below its 10-day average, showing contraction
4. Enter on breakout of the spike's high (for long) or low (for short)

Exit Rules:
1. Initial exit when current volatility (ATR) exceeds 20-day average ATR by 1.5x
2. Secondary exit if price retraces beyond 50% of the breakout move
3. Emergency stop at 2% of account equity

Risk Management:
1. Position size limited to 1% of capital per trade
2. Maximum daily loss limit of 3%
3. No trading during major economic news events
4. Stop-loss placed at recent swing low/high beyond the breakout point

Required Indicators:
1. Delta volume (order flow)
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2 standard deviations)
3. Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) calculation
4. Average True Range (20-period)
5. Volume average (20-period)

Additional Notes:
- Best suited for liquid assets with strong order flow visibility
- Optimal timeframes: 15min to 4hr charts
- Requires clean price action without excessive wicks
- Works best when combined with higher timeframe trend analysis
- Avoid using during low liquidity periods (overnight sessions)

The strategy leverages the unique combination of forced liquidation events (creating explosive moves) with volume confirmation and volatility contraction, providing high-quality breakout opportunities with defined risk parameters.
