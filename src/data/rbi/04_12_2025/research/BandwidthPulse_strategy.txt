STRATEGY_NAME: BandwidthPulse

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The BandwidthPulse strategy combines Bollinger Band contraction patterns with volume confirmation and volatility-based entry triggers for high-probability breakout trades. This approach specifically targets low-volatility periods that typically precede significant price movements.

Key Components:
1. Bollinger Bandwidth Contraction: Measures periods of reduced volatility where bands narrow significantly
2. Volume ROC Divergence: Confirms breakout validity with increasing volume momentum
3. ATR Filter: Ensures sufficient volatility for trade entry
4. Fibonacci Extensions: Provides logical profit targets based on contraction range

Entry Rules:
1. Identify Bollinger Bandwidth contraction (bands narrowing to 20-period low)
2. Confirm with positive Volume ROC divergence (rising volume as price consolidates)
3. Enter long when price breaks above upper band AND exceeds 20-period ATR
4. Enter short when price breaks below lower band AND exceeds 20-period ATR

Exit Rules:
1. Primary target: 1.618 Fibonacci extension of contraction range
2. Secondary target: 2.618 Fibonacci extension if momentum continues
3. Stop-loss: Opposite band level or recent swing low/high (whichever is closer)

Risk Management:
1. Position size based on 1-2% risk per trade
2. Trailing stop activates after 0.618 extension is hit
3. Maximum trade duration: 5 days (avoids false breakouts)

Required Indicators:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Bollinger Bandwidth (20-period)
3. Volume Rate of Change (14-period)
4. Average True Range (20-period)
5. Fibonacci extension tool

Optimization Notes:
- Best suited for 4-hour or daily charts
- Works well with liquid assets showing clear volatility cycles
- Combine with fundamental catalysts for higher success rate
- Avoid using during major news events that may cause false breakouts

The BandwidthPulse strategy excels in capturing explosive moves after consolidation periods while using multiple confirmation layers to filter false breakouts. The Fibonacci extensions provide disciplined profit-taking levels based on the contraction range's mathematical proportions.
