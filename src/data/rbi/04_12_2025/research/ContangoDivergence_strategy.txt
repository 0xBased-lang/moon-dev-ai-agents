STRATEGY_NAME: ContangoDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on the divergence between VIX futures term structure and S&P 500 put/call ratio to identify short-selling opportunities in equity markets. The approach combines volatility market structure analysis with options market sentiment.

Key Components:
1. VIX Futures Term Structure: Monitors the relationship between near-term and longer-dated VIX futures
2. S&P 500 Put/Call Ratio: Tracks the ratio of put options to call options traded on the S&P 500
3. Contango/Backwardation Conditions: Identifies specific term structure formations

Entry Rules:
- SHORT ENTRY when both conditions are met:
  1. VIX futures in contango (front month cheaper than later months)
  2. S&P 500 put/call ratio shows decreasing trend (declining fear)

Exit Rules:
- COVER SHORT when:
  1. VIX term structure inverts to backwardation (front month more expensive)
  2. (Optional) Put/call ratio begins increasing significantly

Risk Management:
1. Position sizing based on volatility (consider VIX level)
2. Stop-loss if term structure steepens further into contango while market rises
3. Time-based exit if position doesn't work within expected timeframe

Required Indicators:
1. VIX futures prices (at least two contract months)
2. S&P 500 put/call ratio (preferably 5-10 day moving average)
3. Term structure visualization tool

Additional Notes:
- Works best during low-volatility regimes
- May underperform during sudden volatility spikes
- Requires monitoring of macroeconomic events that could impact volatility
- Consider combining with technical indicators for confirmation
- Most effective on S&P 500 or related ETFs rather than individual stocks

This strategy exploits the tendency for markets to decline when:
1. Volatility expectations are rising (contango)
2. Traders are becoming complacent (declining put/call ratio)
The exit condition captures when fear becomes more immediate (backwardation), often signaling market bottoms.
