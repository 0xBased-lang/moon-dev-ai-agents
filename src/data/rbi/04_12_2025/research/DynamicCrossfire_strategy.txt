STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicCrossfire

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The DynamicCrossfire strategy combines trend confirmation with momentum strength to identify high-probability trading opportunities. This systematic approach uses three key technical indicators to filter trades and manage risk.

Key Components:
1. Trend Identification (EMA Crossover):
   - 50-period EMA (fast moving average)
   - 200-period EMA (slow moving average)
   - Bullish signal when 50-EMA crosses above 200-EMA (Golden Cross)

2. Trend Strength Filter (ADX):
   - ADX (Average Directional Index) set to 14 periods
   - Confirms strong trend when ADX > 25

3. Momentum Exit (RSI):
   - RSI (Relative Strength Index) set to 14 periods
   - Overbought threshold at 70

Entry Rules:
1. Primary Condition: 50-EMA must cross above 200-EMA
2. Confirmation: ADX must be rising and above 25
3. Entry Timing: Enter long on next candle open after both conditions are met

Exit Rules:
1. Profit Taking: RSI crosses below 70 from above
2. Emergency Exit: 50-EMA crosses back below 200-EMA (trend reversal)
3. Optional: Trailing stop can be set at recent swing low

Risk Management:
1. Position Sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: Place below recent swing low or using ATR-based stop
3. Trade Filter: Only trade when all conditions align (reduces false signals)

Required Indicators:
1. Exponential Moving Averages (50 & 200 periods)
2. Average Directional Index (ADX, 14 periods)
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI, 14 periods)

Optimal Market Conditions:
- Works best in trending markets
- Avoid ranging markets (ADX below 25)
- Most effective on daily or 4-hour timeframes

This strategy combines the reliability of long-term trend confirmation (EMA crossover) with momentum validation (ADX) and disciplined exit management (RSI), creating a robust framework for trend-following trades.
