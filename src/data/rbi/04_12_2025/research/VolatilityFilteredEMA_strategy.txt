STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityFilteredEMA

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines trend-following with volatility filtering to identify high-probability trades during stable market conditions. The key components are:

1. Trend Identification:
- Uses the 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) crossing above the 200-period EMA (Golden Cross) as the primary trend signal
- This crossover indicates potential start of a bullish trend

2. Volatility Filter:
- Requires VIX (Volatility Index) to be below 15 for entry
- This ensures trades are only taken during low-volatility, stable market conditions
- VIX above 20 triggers exits to protect gains during increasing market uncertainty

3. Entry Rules:
- Wait for 50 EMA to cross above 200 EMA (closing basis)
- Confirm VIX is below 15 at time of crossover
- Enter long position on next candle open after both conditions are met

4. Exit Rules:
- Monitor VIX daily
- Exit entire position when VIX closes above 20
- Alternatively, exit if 50 EMA crosses back below 200 EMA (Death Cross)

5. Risk Management:
- Position sizing should account for potential volatility expansion
- Consider using stop-loss at recent swing low or ATR-based stop
- Avoid adding to positions when VIX is between 15-20 (neutral zone)

6. Required Indicators:
- 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
- 200-period EMA
- VIX (Volatility Index) data feed
- Optional: ATR for stop placement

7. Timeframe Considerations:
- Works best on daily charts for swing trading
- Can be adapted to 4-hour charts for shorter-term trades
- Less effective on very short timeframes due to VIX sensitivity

8. Strengths:
- Avoids trading during high volatility periods
- Captures strong trends during stable markets
- Simple, rules-based approach

9. Limitations:
- May miss early trend entries if VIX is slightly above 15
- Requires monitoring of both price and VIX
- Potential whipsaws during transitional market periods

10. Optimization Notes:
- VIX thresholds can be adjusted based on market regime (15/20 works for normal conditions)
- EMA periods can be tested (e.g., 20/50 for faster signals)
- Consider adding volume confirmation for stronger signals

This strategy is particularly effective in bull markets and during periods of sustained low volatility, providing a systematic way to participate in trends while avoiding high-risk environments.
