STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityThreshold  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Filter:** Uses the 20-day Average True Range (ATR) to identify low-volatility conditions when it drops below its 10th percentile (historically derived).  
2. **Trend Confirmation:** Requires price to cross above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to confirm a bullish trend.  
3. **Exit Mechanism:** Combines a dynamic stop-loss (2x ATR) and a fixed holding period (5 days) to lock in profits or limit losses.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** The 20-day ATR must be below its 10th percentile (calculated over a lookback period, e.g., 6–12 months).  
- **Condition 2:** Price must close above the 50-day SMA.  
- **Action:** Enter a long position on the next candle’s open if both conditions are met.  

**Exit Rules:**  
1. **Stop-Loss:** Exit if price drops below the entry price minus 2x the current 20-day ATR.  
2. **Time-Based Exit:** Close the position after 5 trading days, regardless of profit/loss.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position sizing should account for the 2x ATR stop to limit risk per trade (e.g., 1–2% of capital).  
- Avoid trading during earnings announcements or major news events to prevent volatility spikes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. **20-day ATR** (for volatility percentile calculation).  
2. **50-day SMA** (for trend confirmation).  
3. **Historical ATR Percentiles** (requires backtesting to define the 10th percentile threshold).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines mean-reversion (low ATR) and trend-following (SMA crossover) elements.  
- Uses a dual exit approach to balance short-term gains and volatility protection.  
- Adapts to changing market conditions by focusing on relative volatility extremes.  

**Optimization Tips:**  
- Test different ATR percentiles (e.g., 5th–15th) to fine-trade sensitivity.  
- Experiment with SMA periods (e.g., 30-day or 100-day) for trend alignment.  
- Adjust the holding period (3–7 days) based on asset volatility.
