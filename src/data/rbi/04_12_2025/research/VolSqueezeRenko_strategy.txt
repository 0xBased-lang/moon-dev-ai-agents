STRATEGY_NAME: VolSqueezeRenko  

STRATEGY_DETAILS:  
**Key Strategy Components:**  
1. **Volatility Contraction:** Uses Bollinger Bandwidth (BBW) to identify periods of low volatility when the bandwidth falls below a historical percentile (e.g., 20th percentile).  
2. **Volume Imbalance Surge:** Monitors TICK volume imbalance (buying vs. selling pressure) for a sudden spike, confirming potential breakout momentum.  
3. **Renko Brick Reversal:** Requires a breakout confirmation via a Renko brick reversal (e.g., a green brick after a squeeze) to filter false breakouts.  

**Entry Rules:**  
- **Condition 1:** BBW contracts below its 20th percentile (indicating a volatility squeeze).  
- **Condition 2:** TICK volume imbalance surges above a predefined threshold (e.g., +500 or -500 for extreme buying/selling pressure).  
- **Condition 3:** A Renko brick reversal occurs in the direction of the breakout (e.g., a bullish reversal brick after a squeeze).  
- **Entry:** Go long/short on the close of the confirming Renko brick.  

**Exit Rules:**  
- **Take Profit:** Use a multiple of the recent ATR (e.g., 2x ATR) or a fixed percentage target.  
- **Stop Loss:** Place below the recent swing low (long) or above the swing high (short) on the Renko chart.  
- **Trailing Stop:** Optional – trail using a percentage or Renko brick reversal in the opposite direction.  

**Risk Management:**  
- Position size based on a fixed % of capital (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).  
- Stop loss is mandatory and should be adjusted based on Renko brick size to avoid whipsaws.  
- Avoid trading during major news events to prevent erratic TICK spikes.  

**Required Indicators:**  
1. Bollinger Bands (for BBW calculation).  
2. TICK volume imbalance data (NYSE TICK or similar).  
3. Renko chart with adjustable brick size (e.g., ATR-based).  
4. ATR (for profit target sizing).  

**Unique Aspects:**  
- Combines volatility compression, volume imbalance, and Renko’s noise-filtering properties.  
- Renko confirmation reduces false breakouts common in traditional squeeze strategies.  
- TICK surge adds momentum confirmation, improving breakout reliability.  

**Note:** Backtest optimal BBW percentile threshold, TICK imbalance levels, and Renko brick size for the traded instrument.
