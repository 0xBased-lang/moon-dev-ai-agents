STRATEGY_NAME: QuantumReversal

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy leverages quantum-inspired momentum to identify and capitalize on short-term price reversals. The core approach involves analyzing order flow imbalance across multiple time frames (15-60 minutes) using fractal patterns as a leading indicator of reversal potential. Confirmation is provided by high volatility metrics such as the Average True Range (ATR). 

Entry rules are triggered when these conditions converge, signaling an intra-day price reversal likelihood. The strategy then sets up gamma short positions to hedge against market moves while maintaining limited downside risk through position sizing based on current volatility levels.

Risk management incorporates stop-loss thresholds proportional to expected profit targets and dynamic adjustments for changing market conditions. A trailing stop is also employed during trending periods to lock in profits or limit losses.
