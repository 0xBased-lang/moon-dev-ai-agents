STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceProtect

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

The DivergenceProtect strategy is a risk-managed options trading approach that focuses on identifying divergent patterns between the VIX futures and the S&P 500 index price action to create buying opportunities for put options. The strategy combines technical analysis with a deep understanding of market volatility.

**Key Strategy Components:**

1. **VIX Futures Divergence:** Buy put options when the 20-day VIX futures diverge from the 20-day S&P 500 price action. This divergence indicates that market participants are expecting lower volatility, while the underlying index is showing a different trend.
2. **Maximum Leverage:** Use a maximum of 2x leverage to amplify potential gains while limiting risk exposure.
3. **Exit Rule:** Close all positions at the first breach of a 10-trading-day moving average.

**Entry Rules:**

1. **VIX Futures Divergence:** Check if the 20-day VIX futures are diverging from the 20-day S&P 500 price action. This can be done using a VIX futures indicator or a candlestick pattern analysis.
2. **Price Confirmation:** Verify that the underlying index is showing a bearish trend, as indicated by a downtrend in its price action.

**Exit Rules:**

1. **Moving Average Breach:** Set a 10-trading-day moving average at a specific price level (e.g., 1000). Close all positions when the first trading day's close price breaches this level.
2. **Maximum Leverage Breach:** If the maximum leverage (2x) is breached, immediately close all positions to limit potential losses.

**Risk Management:**

1. **Position Sizing:** Use a percentage-based position sizing strategy to manage risk exposure. For example, if the account size is $10,000, allocate 20% of it for each trade.
2. **Stop-Loss Order:** Set a stop-loss order at a reasonable distance below the entry price (e.g., 5-7% away). This will help limit potential losses if the trade does not go in favor.

**Required Indicators:**

1. **VIX Futures Indicator:** Use an indicator that displays the 20-day VIX futures chart, such as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) futures indicator.
2. **S&P 500 Price Action:** Use a price action indicator to analyze the underlying index's trend and identify potential buy opportunities.
3. **Moving Average Indicator:** Use an indicator that displays the 10-trading-day moving average, such as a simple moving average or an exponential moving average (EMA).
