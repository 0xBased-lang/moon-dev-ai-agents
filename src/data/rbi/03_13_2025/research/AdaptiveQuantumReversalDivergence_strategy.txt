STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveQuantumReversalDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
The "AdaptiveQuantumReversalDivergence" strategy combines adaptive trading techniques with quantum-inspired divergence analysis to identify profitable market entries and exits. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - **Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)**: The strategy employs an AMA that dynamically adjusts its smoothing factor based on market volatility, ensuring relevance in changing conditions.
   - **Quantum-Inspired Divergence**: Utilizes advanced divergence analysis, akin to quantum superposition states, to anticipate price reversals with high precision.

2. **Entry/Exit Rules**:
   - **Entry Signals**: Triggered when the AMA converges and diverges with the price action during uptrends or downtrends.
   - **Exit Signals**: Generated by divergence reversal accompanied by a bearish/bullish trend, ensuring timely exits to capitalize on reversals.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - **Stop-Loss Orders**: Implemented at predefined levels to limit potential losses on each trade.
   - **Trailing Stops**: Utilized during trending sessions to dynamically adjust risk exposure as prices move in the expected direction.
   - **Position Sizing**: Managed through a dynamic position sizing model that adjusts based on volatility and market conditions.

4. **Required Indicators**:
   - **Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)**: Central to price action analysis.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Used to confirm momentum trends and validate entry/exit signals.
   - **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Employs MACD to detect divergence points, enhancing the timing of potential reversals.

This strategy is designed for scalping and medium-term trading, emphasizing precision in market analysis and rapid response to price changes.
