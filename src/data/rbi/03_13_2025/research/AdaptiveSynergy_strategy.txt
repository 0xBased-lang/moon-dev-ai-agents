STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveSynergy

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines momentum analysis with relative strength (RS) and stochastic oscillator (Sto) to identify trading opportunities. Here's how it works:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - **Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)**: Calculates momentum dynamically, adjusting based on market conditions.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Measures the strength of a security's price action.
   - **Stochastic Oscillator (Sto)**: Identifies potential reversals by comparing closing prices to recent price ranges.

2. **Entry/Exit Rules**:
   - **Entry**: Buy when RSI or Sto diverges from a bullish AMA, indicating a possible trend reversal.
   - **Exit**: Close trades when the divergence reverses or a price correction occurs.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Use stop-loss orders at entry points to limit losses.
   - Adjust position sizing based on risk tolerance percentages.

By integrating these elements, the strategy aims for high-probability trades with adaptability to market shifts.
