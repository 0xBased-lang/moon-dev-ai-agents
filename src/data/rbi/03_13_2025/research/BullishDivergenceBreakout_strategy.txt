STRATEGY_NAME: BullishDivergenceBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
Bullish Divergence Breakout is a trend-following strategy that utilizes bullish divergence patterns to identify potential long entry points in conjunction with expanding Bollinger Bands volatility and a breakout above the upper Keltner Channel. This strategy seeks to capitalize on the momentum of a price move while managing risk through a combination of indicators.

Key Strategy Components:

1. **Bullish Divergence**: The strategy looks for bullish divergence patterns, which occur when the price makes a lower high but the oscillator (e.g., RSI or MACD) makes a higher low.
2. **Expanded Bollinger Bands Volatility**: The strategy enters long positions when the upper Keltner Channel is broken above and Bollinger Bands volatility is expanding. This indicates increased price uncertainty, making it more likely that the price will continue to rise.
3. **Upper Keltner Channel Breakout**: The strategy enters long positions only after the price breaks above the upper Keltner Channel, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Entry/Exit Rules:

1. **Long Entry**:
	* Price must break above the upper Keltner Channel.
	* Bollinger Bands volatility must be expanding (i.e., the upper band is farther away from the middle band than it was in previous periods).
	* Bullish divergence pattern must occur on the same price bar as the breakout.
2. **Long Exit**:
	* Price must correct below the upper Keltner Channel.
3. **Short Position**: If the strategy enters a short position, exit will be triggered when the price breaks below the lower Keltner Channel.

Risk Management:

1. **Position Sizing**: The strategy uses a fixed percentage of the account balance for each trade (e.g., 2%).
2. **Stop-Loss**: A stop-loss order is set at the previous high or 20 pips below the entry price, whichever is greater.
3. **Take-Profit**: A take-profit target is set at 20 pips above the entry price.

Required Indicators:

1. **Keltner Channels**: To determine the upper and lower bounds of the channel.
2. **Bollinger Bands**: To measure volatility and identify expanding patterns.
3. **Oscillator (e.g., RSI or MACD)**: To detect bullish divergence patterns.
4. **Candlestick Chart**: For price action and trend analysis.

By combining these indicators, Bullish Divergence Breakout aims to capture the momentum of a strong price move while managing risk through position sizing, stop-loss orders, and take-profit targets.
