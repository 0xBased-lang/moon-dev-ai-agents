Patrick's trading strategy is built on several key elements that help him identify market movements and execute trades effectively. Here's a structured overview of his approach:

1. **Market Wave Analysis**: Patrick views the market as moving in cyclical wavesâ€”upward (uptrend) and downward (downtrend). He suggests entering trades at the bottom of an uptrend or the top of a downtrend, anticipating reversals when conditions change.

2. **Pivot Points and VWAP**: Pivot points are used to identify potential support and resistance levels. Patrick emphasizes using these as key trading points. Additionally, he incorporates Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), which provides a slower-moving average than pivot points, offering more reliable signals during market consolidation.

3. **Risk Management with Stop-Loss Orders**: He employs stop-loss orders at 2-3% or 10 points (whichever is higher) to limit potential losses. This strategy allows him to exit trades effectively once setups are confirmed.

4. **Quick Entry and Exit**: Patrick primarily uses Market orders due to his active trading on a funded account with Apex, which provides instant fills. He aims to trade quickly to avoid missing momentum opportunities.

5. **Confirmation Techniques**: He relies on volume action, price reversal signals, and indicator divergence (like RSI) to confirm setups before executing trades.

6. **Trading Process**: His strategy involves setting up notifications for potential setups using tools like Volume Profiles and RSI divergence alerts, ensuring he remains responsive to market changes.

7. **Specific Setup Types**: Patrick plans to delve into specific setups such as TBA, TBB, and RSI divergence in future streams, expanding his trading toolkit.

In summary, Patrick's strategy focuses on wave analysis, using VWAP for confirmation, effective risk management with stop-loss orders, and quick execution with active-trading tools. This approach allows him to capture trends efficiently while minimizing risks.
