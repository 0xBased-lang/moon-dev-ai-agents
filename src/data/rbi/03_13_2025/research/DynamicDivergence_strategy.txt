STRATEGY_NAME: DynamicDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on shorting gamma positions during periods of high order flow imbalance, which is interpreted as a signal for potential intra-day price reversals on shorter time frames. The approach leverages the concept of dynamic divergence to identify and capitalize on these conditions. Key components include:

1. **Key Strategy Components**:
   - Utilizes gamma positions in trading strategies.
   - Employs order flow imbalance detection.
   - Observes intra-day price reversal trends on shorter intervals.

2. **Entry/Exit Rules**:
   - Enters short positions when order flow imbalance signals a divergence point, suggesting increased selling pressure.
   - Exits trades upon confirmation of the price reversal or when the imbalance subsides.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Implements stop-loss mechanisms to limit potential losses.
   - Monitors position size relative to account risk tolerance.

4. **Required Indicators**:
   - Requires divergence analysis tools, such as On-Balance Volume (OBV) or Balance of Power (BoP), to identify imbalance conditions.
