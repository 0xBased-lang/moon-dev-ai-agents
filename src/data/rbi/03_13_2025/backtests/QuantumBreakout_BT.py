**Answer:**

The name for this strategy is **FibonacciResBreak**.

### Explanation:

1. **Strategy Overview**: 
   - The FibonacciRetracementLevel-based trading strategy aims to identify potential support/resistance levels using Fibonacci ratios (e.g., 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%).
   - The strategy executes a long position when the price breaks above a resistance level and exits via Take-Profit or Stop-Loss rules.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Cleaned column names by removing spaces (e.g., ' Open' becomes 'Open').
   - Dropped any columns with names containing 'unnamed'.

3. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels Calculation**:
   - Identified the high and low points within a specified lookback period.
   - Calculated Fibonacci support/resistance levels based on these extremes.

4. **Entry/Exit Logic**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy (long position) when price breaks above resistance level.
   - **Exit Signal**: 
     - Take-Profit: Price reaches predefined Fibonacci retracement levels below the resistance level.
     - Stop-Loss: Price reverts to a lower support level.

5. **Risk Management**:
   - Stop-loss and take-profit thresholds based on predefined percentages of position size.

6. **Position Sizing**:
   - Position size set at 1,000,000 units as specified.
   - Risk-adjusted sizing using appropriate stop-loss mechanisms.

7. **Backtesting Execution**:
   - Implemented backtest with default parameters first to assess performance.
   - Adjusted parameters based on initial results for optimization.
