After reviewing your code, I can see that you're taking steps to avoid using functions from `backtesting.lib`. Here's a summary of what needs to be done:

1. **Check for Forbidden Imports**:
   - You've already replaced `ta.RSI` with `pandas-ta` in `_init_indicators`, which is good.
   - No other imports from `backtesting.lib` are present.

2. **Replace Indicator Functions if Necessary**:
   - For example, if you're using `rsi()` or `macd()`, you should replace them with the appropriate pandas-ta functions (`pandas_rsi()`, `pandas_macd()`).

3. **Ensure All Backtest Data is Valid**:
   - The code already includes validation checks for data types (DataFrame/Series) and cleaning steps.

4. **Consider Testing Your Indicators**:
   - Make sure your indicators are working as expected before integrating them into the trading logic.

Since you're already avoiding `backtesting.lib`, there's no immediate need to modify other parts of the code related to that library. However, if you encounter any issues with indicator functions or data validation, let me know!
