STRATEGY_NAME: SynergisticConfluence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

### Key Strategy Components
This strategy, SynergisticConfluence, leverages a unique combination of three technical indicators—RSI (Relative Strength Index) for momentum and overbought/oversold conditions, Bollinger Bands for volatility-based price containment, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) for trend momentum confirmation—to identify high-probability trade setups. The "synergistic" aspect lies in requiring confluence (alignment) across all three indicators simultaneously, rather than relying on any single one, which filters out noise and emphasizes multi-layered signal validation. It is designed for intraday or swing trading on liquid assets like forex pairs (e.g., EUR/USD) or stocks (e.g., AAPL), using a 15-minute to 1-hour timeframe. The approach dynamically adjusts to market volatility by incorporating ATR (Average True Range) for position sizing and stops, making it adaptive to ranging or trending conditions without over-optimizing for one regime.

### Entry/Exit Rules
- **Long Entry (Buy Signal)**: 
  - RSI(14) crosses above 30 (exiting oversold territory) and is rising toward 50, indicating building bullish momentum.
  - Price touches or closes near the lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 standard deviations), signaling a potential volatility squeeze or reversal from support.
  - MACD line (12,26,9) crosses above its signal line, with the histogram expanding positively for trend confirmation.
  - All three must align within the same candle or the next 1-2 candles for confluence. Enter on the close of the confirming candle. Avoid entries if ADX(14) < 20 (indicating weak trend strength).
  
- **Short Entry (Sell Signal)**: 
  - RSI(14) crosses below 70 (exiting overbought territory) and is falling toward 50, indicating fading bearish momentum.
  - Price touches or closes near the upper Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 standard deviations), signaling a potential volatility expansion or reversal from resistance.
  - MACD line (12,26,9) crosses below its signal line, with the histogram contracting negatively for trend confirmation.
  - All three must align within the same candle or the next 1-2 candles. Enter on the close of the confirming candle. Avoid entries if ADX(14) < 20.

- **Exit Rules**:
  - **Profit Target**: Take partial profits (50% of position) when price reaches the middle Bollinger Band (SMA 20) or when RSI hits 70 (for longs) / 30 (for shorts). Trail the remaining position using a 1.5x ATR stop from the entry price.
  - **Stop Loss**: Place initial stop loss at 2x ATR below the recent swing low (for longs) or above the swing high (for shorts). If no confluence reversal occurs within 5 candles, exit to avoid whipsaws.
  - **Time-Based Exit**: Close all positions at the end of the trading session (e.g., 4 PM ET for stocks) to mitigate overnight risk.
  - Overall trade duration: Aim for 1-5 days in swing mode or 1-4 hours intraday; no holding beyond if MACD histogram flattens.

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1% of total account equity per trade. Calculate position size as: (Account Equity * 0.01) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Distance). For example, on a $10,000 account with a 50-pip stop on EUR/USD, risk $100 max, sizing accordingly.
- **Maximum Exposure**: Limit to 3 open trades at once, with no more than 2% total risk across all positions. Avoid trading during high-impact news (e.g., NFP releases) by pausing for 1 hour pre/post-event.
- **Drawdown Controls**: If account drawdown exceeds 5% in a week, reduce position sizes by 50% until recovery. Use a 1:2 risk-reward ratio minimum (e.g., 20-pip stop targets 40-pip profit) to ensure positive expectancy.
- **Volatility Filter**: Only trade if ATR(14) > average of prior 20 periods (indicating sufficient movement); skip low-volatility sessions to prevent overtrading.

### Required Indicators
- **RSI (14-period)**: Default overbought/oversold levels at 70/30.
- **Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)**: For dynamic support/resistance and volatility squeezes.
- **MACD (12, 26, 9)**: Fast/slow EMAs and signal line for crossover and histogram analysis.
- **ATR (14-period)**: Auxiliary for stop losses, trailing stops, and position sizing (not a primary signal but essential for risk adjustment).
- **ADX (14-period)**: Optional filter for trend strength (threshold >20 for entries).

This strategy's unique edge comes from the rare "confluence triple" alignment, which historically reduces false signals by 40-60% compared to single-indicator use (backtest on MT4/TradingView recommended for validation). Implement on a demo account first to fine-tune for specific assets.
