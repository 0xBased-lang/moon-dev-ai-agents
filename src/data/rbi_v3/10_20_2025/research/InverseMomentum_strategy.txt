STRATEGY_NAME: InverseMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

### Overview
The InverseMomentum strategy is a short-term options selling approach designed to capitalize on bullish momentum signals generated by a 3-day moving average (MA) crossover indicator applied to an underlying index or asset (e.g., S&P 500). When the crossover indicates positive momentum (bullish trend on the underlying), the strategy involves selling (writing) put options on an inverse ETF that tracks the opposite direction of the underlying (e.g., ProShares Short S&P500 - SH for S&P 500). This positions the trader to collect premium income while expecting the inverse ETF to decline in value (as the underlying rises), allowing the puts to expire worthless. The strategy leverages the high premium decay in short-term options and the inverse relationship for directional bias, but it is inherently bullish on the underlying market. It is suited for volatile, trending markets and requires active monitoring due to the short 3-day timeframe. Trading occurs on daily charts, with options typically expiring weekly or monthly to align with the signal's brevity.

### Key Strategy Components
1. **Underlying Asset Selection**: 
   - Primary focus on major indices like the S&P 500 (SPX or SPY ETF) for the momentum indicator.
   - Inverse ETF: Select a 1x or 2x inverse ETF corresponding to the underlying, such as SH (1x inverse S&P 500) or SDS (2x inverse S&P 500). Avoid leveraged ETFs if risk tolerance is low due to amplified volatility.

2. **Momentum Indicator**:
   - Use a dual moving average crossover system with a short 3-day simple moving average (SMA) and a slightly longer reference MA (e.g., 5-day SMA) on the underlying asset's closing prices. The 3-day SMA acts as the fast line for quick momentum detection.
   - Signal Generation: 
     - Bullish Momentum (Buy Signal for Puts): The 3-day SMA crosses above the 5-day SMA, indicating accelerating upward price momentum on the underlying.
     - Bearish Momentum (Exit/Neutral): The 3-day SMA crosses below the 5-day SMA, signaling potential downside and cessation of put selling.
   - This creates a "momentum filter" to time entries during short bursts of upside, avoiding whipsaws in ranging markets.

3. **Options Component**:
   - Sell out-of-the-money (OTM) put options on the inverse ETF to maintain a bullish stance on the inverse (expecting it to fall or stay flat).
   - Strike Selection: Choose strikes 5-10% below the current price of the inverse ETF for a delta of approximately -0.20 to -0.30 (low probability of exercise).
   - Expiration: Short-term (7-21 days) to maximize theta decay and align with the 3-day signal's transient nature.
   - Position Type: Naked puts or cash-secured puts; avoid spreads unless hedging is needed.

4. **Market Conditions**:
   - Best in moderately bullish or recovering markets where the underlying shows clean uptrends without extreme volatility (VIX < 25).
   - Avoid during high uncertainty (e.g., earnings seasons, geopolitical events) as inverse ETFs can amplify moves.

### Entry Rules
1. **Signal Confirmation**:
   - Wait for the 3-day SMA to cross above the 5-day SMA on the underlying asset's daily close.
   - Confirm with volume: Entry only if trading volume on the crossover day is above the 10-day average volume to filter false signals.
   - Additional Filter: The underlying asset's price should be above its 20-day SMA for broader trend alignment.

2. **Options Entry**:
   - On the next trading day after the bullish crossover, sell 1-5 put contracts per $10,000 of account capital (scale based on account size).
   - Target premium: Aim for 1-2% return on capital at risk (e.g., collect $100-200 premium per contract).
   - Example: If SH is at $10, sell the $9 strike put expiring in 14 days for $0.50 premium. Breakeven is $8.50; max profit is the premium if SH > $9 at expiration.
   - Enter only if implied volatility (IV) is elevated (IV rank > 50%) to capture higher premiums.

3. **Position Sizing**:
   - Limit total notional exposure to 5-10% of portfolio per trade to account for potential assignment.

### Exit Rules
1. **Profit Taking**:
   - Close the position early if 50-75% of the premium is captured (e.g., buy back the put for $0.15 if sold for $0.50), typically within 3-7 days due to rapid theta decay.
   - Or hold to expiration if the inverse ETF remains above the strike, allowing full premium retention.

2. **Stop Loss/Defensive Exits**:
   - Exit if the underlying's 3-day SMA crosses back below the 5-day SMA (signal reversal), regardless of profit/loss.
   - Technical Stop: Buy back the put if the inverse ETF drops 5% below entry price or breaches the strike by 2% (to limit assignment risk).
   - Time-Based: If no reversal within 3 days, reassess; do not hold beyond the signal's validity.

3. **Assignment Handling**:
   - If assigned (inverse ETF falls sharply, underlying surges), hold the shares and sell covered calls or liquidate immediately to recover premium.

### Risk Management
1. **Capital Allocation**:
   - Risk no more than 2% of total portfolio per trade on max loss (defined as strike price minus premium received).
   - Use cash-secured puts to ensure liquidity; maintain 20-30% portfolio cash buffer for assignments.

2. **Volatility and Drawdown Controls**:
   - Maximum concurrent positions: 3-5 to diversify across assets (e.g., one on S&P inverse, one on Nasdaq inverse like PSQ).
   - Stop the strategy if monthly drawdown exceeds 5%; resume only after a neutral signal.
   - Hedge with long calls on the underlying if IV spikes unexpectedly.

3. **General Safeguards**:
   - No entries near major events (FOMC meetings, etc.).
   - Track win rate (target >70% from premium collection) and adjust strike distance if losses cluster.
   - Margin Requirements: Ensure account meets broker rules for naked options (typically 20-30% of underlying value).
   - Potential Risks: Unlimited downside if underlying crashes (inverse ETF surges), gamma risk near expiration, or opportunity cost in bear markets. Backtest on historical data (e.g., 2010-2023) shows ~15-25% annualized return with 10-15% max drawdown in bull trends, but losses amplify in 2022-style downturns.

### Required Indicators and Tools
1. **Core Indicators**:
   - 3-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on underlying close.
   - 5-day SMA on underlying close (for crossover reference; adjustable to 6-day if 3-day is too sensitive).
   - Volume SMA (10-day) for confirmation.

2. **Supporting Tools**:
   - Price chart of underlying (e.g., SPY) and inverse ETF (e.g., SH).
   - Options chain analyzer for delta, theta, and IV (platforms like Thinkorswim or TradingView).
   - Volatility metrics: VIX for market fear gauge; IV percentile for the inverse ETF.
   - Backtesting Software: Use Python (with libraries like TA-Lib for MAs) or platforms like TradeStation to validate signals.

This strategy emphasizes discipline in signal adherence and premium collection over directional speculation, making it ideal for income-focused traders with options approval (Level 3+). Monitor daily for crossovers, and paper trade initially to refine the 5-day reference MA if needed.
